Alwaysinit,1,This is not a behavior that we should support; Playstation,the United States ,20201112,False,"  This will no doubt come off as someone who is bitter because they could not get a PS5. That is part of it, but hear me out. This is a company that knew very well, that the demand for this product would be high. They had experience with almost every console release in their history being a problem at retail. Now, in the year 2020, where console sales are at an all time high- they chose to roll the dice again on consumer trust.I was there on pre-sale - no dice. I was there on every mailing list, notification, reddit thread- no dice. On launch day imagine staying up trying to hit every single retail outlet drop and still failing. Not even failing in any way that I could blame myself for, but failing because the way they sell these units is completely corrupt and disingenuous.So you spend all this time hunting a unit, failing, watching people get 2, 3, 4 units to sell as resellers. One has to ask what responsibility does Sony have in all this? My guess is, a lot. They are toying with their consumers. They are teasing us. They are making the experience worse. And I have to say at this point I am ready to boycott.This isn't the kind of attitude that I would support in any product offering.Not only one of the most expensive systems released during the cusp of a world wide economic depression, but now a phony scarcity structure rewarding resellers over real customers who go above and beyond to give you their money? No thanks.",15372,english

Vincent,5,"Next Gen PlayStation, Controller",the United States ,20201112,False,"  Going over hardware and software. Not going over the every exact technical specs as you can easily look that up. Software can change overtime, this is review of software at launch. If any hardware hiccups or failures in near future I'll update this review--Hardware:Physical:Looks futuristic yet tacky. In my personal opinion, looks doesn't really matter as long it can play next gen games wellLarge console. Standing up it's the tallest home video console.A lot of air-vents throughout making it aerodynamic, cool, quiet, and does not overheat or get hot with consecutive gameplay hours. This may change in the future if games require more performance out of the system, with similar fate like the PS4 where it was whisper quiet in beginning and became louder over the years with more graphical intensive games.Has LED lights giving it a PC look (?)Face plate easy to take out for future customization options (?).667of 820gb of free download space in consoleSwapping SDD is not as easy as Xbox Series X (with it's plug and play method) as you have to remove some screws. Upside is that it's standard and not a propriety SDD.PS5 is compatible with most PS4 games. If you have an external SDD from PS4 it's just plug and transfer to PS5 internal storageComes with stand. Console is not entirely flat, so stand is required for horizontal position. You have console in vertical position without stand, but does not have grip (rubber feet) so may slide if bumped into or during an earthquakeFront of console: USB-C, USB-A, power, and eject buttonBack of console: Two USB-A (Super Speed), LAN port, HDMI, and power portWished it had more USB-C ports to be future proof, but guess they kept USB-A for some current accessories to be backwards compatible. Disappointed the PS5 official 3D pulse headset and camera uses USB-A. Also no optical audio port means i can't use some of my surround sound headsets.Load times for PS5 games are instantaneous. Ps4 games will load much faster, even without optimized patch.Ps5 have ray tracing giving games realistic lighting effects-Controller:Console comes with one controllerPhysically larger than past DuelShock controllers. Great for those with adult sized handsGreat tech demo included with 'Astro's Playroom'. Haptic feedback. Similar to Nintendo Switch HD rumble, but more apparent.  Not sure if developers will implement in future their games. Even with Nintendo first party; only '1-2 Switch' and 'Mario Party' from what I recall used HD rumble at great extent and it dropped off after that.Adaptive triggers. Will feel resistance/push back on triggers if developers implement it in game.Hope both Haptic feedback and Adaptive triggers say the entire lifespan and transfer to PS6 instead of dropping off like the six axis on PS3 and light bar in PS4Has built in mic. Sound quality is similar to current smart phone on speaker. Has mute buttonSimilar to PS4, it has speaker and touch pad. Touch pad is more sensitive this time aroundAbout double battery life of Ps4 controller. Able to get in 10 consecutive hoursWished it came with back paddle buttons. Hopefully they release a DualSense Back Button Attachment like they did the DualShock 4You can play PS4 games with DualShock 4 or DualSense . PS5 games only can be played with DualSense--SoftwareUI, OS is the similar to PS4 with scrolling apps/games (left, right, up, down)There's an activity row where you can track your progress on gamesOther rows are News and PSN storeThere are notifications popups, but you can turn on 'Do Not Disturb' modeSimilar to phone's swipe down tool bar for basic profile (trophy list, avatar, user info,etc), accessibility options, sound,  Game Base, internet wifi select, controllers (see connected controllers), etc on home screen for easy access.'Game Base' section is where you make party with friends and chat with them, view friend requests.Share button this time around will pull up menu to take snap shot, record video, or save video previously played game session for up to 60minsThere's an 'Your Accolades' feature where you give props to other players. Reminds me of how to give endorsements (Sportsmanship, Good Teammate, Shot Caller) in Overwatch to encourage positivity in online community. For PS5 has Helpful, Welcoming, and Good SportThere are accessibility options/preferences you can setup that transfers to your gamesThere's a 'Switcher' option where you can change games on the fly, but unlike the Xbox Series X's 'quick resume' does not leave where you left off, and will boot you back to the home screen of that gamePicture-in-picture mode if you want friends to help show you how to get through levelsPS4 games load faster on PS5 if downloaded to SSD. Graphical upgrade depends on publisher if they implement a 'PS5 upgrade"" patch-For PS5 trophies.Trophies that have collectables there is a progress bar showing how much left to collect.There are also tutorial videos for some games that implement it.Some trophies once selected will drop you into the level/section where you can obtain the trophy. Again depends on game developer if they implement it.PS4 trophies on PS5 act the sameBase price for games are $70 ($10 more than last gen); Excluding Special/Collector's editions, DLC, micro-transactions, loot crates, and surprise mechanicsOverall, aside from some odd design choices very capable next gen system. There are some features especially on the controller that developers have to utilize and may not be present in all games. If anything like the PS3 and PS4, going to have thousands of gameplay hours on this system",795,english

There should be no reason why there isn’t a “Get in Line” system where anyone and everyone can pre-order, take a spot in line and as they ship the fulfill them in the order the customers were in.

When I called customer service as to why my notifications never came through the explanation was a a ""glitch"" in the system.Due to health reasons... This could well be my last Christmas with my son who is 14... I cannot afford the ridiculous amounts the resellers are asking... I had planned on using my Amazon rewards dollars to purchase this.. Apparently that isn't going to happen. The way this entire roll out has been handled by the largest media company in the world and the largest retailer in the world is a travesty. This is personal and yes.. It hurts.Shame on me for assuming it would be handled in an orderly manner. Selling prior to the release time.. Then no e available when it comes as supposed to be... Even the playstation direct site only says check back tomorrow for additional units... That didn't happen either and it's not like I can be held hostage staring at my phone or a computer screen for hours. I got into the que on the 13th and when I was down to a 2 minute wait Sony logged me out and back to an hour wait which by then of course it was sold out again. They said more units to drop on the 14th... Didn't happen.Great loyalty to long time users while resellers are now charging well over 1k per unit.",149,english

Amzn Cust,4,Extremely Disappointed then Pleasantly Surprised,the United States ,20201115,True,"  I was so excited to have been able to order one for delivery on release day. System looked and worked beautifully until I got to the Home Screen at which point the GPU started going crazy throwing bad lines of pixels all over the place after about 20 seconds of being on. After over 5 hours of actively trying to call Sony support, I finally got through for them to say the only option to to send it in to their repair center. This involves a 3-5 day delay for them to ship me a box, then 3-5 days back to the service center. Once they receive it, 10-15 days to repair/replace my unit. Lastly, 3-5 days back to me. At this point I’ll be lucky to get one by Christmas. I wish you luck that you don’t end up with a defective unit but my advice would be to wait until the initial batch issues are fixed and/or Sony at least has a better repair process.UPDATE: Yesterday I was notified Sony had sent me a package overnight. When I opened the package today, they sent a letter apologizing and acknowledging how frustrating it must be to get a defective unit. The best part, they sent me a NEW unit in the box with instructions to return my defective one. I can’t say how surprised I was and happy to have a working PS5. Their customer service really came through and I appreciate the effort here. Best of luck to you all finding a unit!",88,english

Chris S,1,Never Buying A Console From Amazon Again,the United States ,20201123,True,"  I was lucky enough to get a pre-order for a PS5 and was obviously excited to get it on launch day, but that went down the drain when I received the order. First of all, when it was delivered, the box was WIDE OPEN. Second, it has NO PROTECTION around it. It was just a brand new PS5 in a big, banged-up box that was on a delivery truck more than likely moving around for 2 days. After seeing all that, I setup the PS5 and everything seems to be working fine, and then I see pixels all over the screen and I can no longer run any games. I don't know if it was a result of how bad the protection was or if my PS5 console just had issues out the box, but I basically had a busted PS5 for the entire weekend. Trying to figure this out, I told Amazon and everyone I talked to was very unwilling to help. I basically had to keep calling PlayStation support until someone helped me fix the issue (which was send it in for repairs). What should have been an awesome weekend turned into what felt like a $500+ mistake and I will never buy a launch console from here again since that's how they treat their Prime customer.",50,english
Daniel V.,5,Ignore negative comments about non-purchase reviews!,the United States ,20201117,True,"  We all know what this console is capable of if you follow the news. It truly revolutionizes console gaming. What I will say is that I do not believe it is fair that people are rating the ps5 1 star just because they were unable to aquire it on launch day. People come to see reviews that reflect the ps5 capabilities and user experience, not about people being disappointed about failing to buy it on launch.With that being said, my experience with my Ps5 has been amazing. Everything advertised about it is flawless. The hardware is sleek, and futuristic looking. The controller feels much more durable than the ps4's controller and very comfortable to hold. The thumbsticks allow for greater movement, it's MUCH easier for you to aim with than with old controllers. The adaptive triggers and dualsense are very immersive and a gift from God himself. You actually have a mic and speaker with a mute button on the controller to speak with your friends if you still don't have a mic.The ps5 itself has insanely fast loading times, just as we saw advertised on the news. The 4k 120fps graphics are such a gift, I will never go back to 1080p again, as the games just look ugly now lol. Games like Battlefield 1 look absolutely gorgeous on my 4k Acer Nitro, and that game already looked beautiful on ps4 as well. I'm not mentioning COD because that franchise has gone to the trash since 2012 with an exception, BO3. It's a disappointment there weren't many ps5 games on release, most everyone is playing a ps4 game upgraded visually to ps5 like BF1.This is the reason why I'd advise those of you who haven't gotten lucky and snagged your ps5 on release day to have patience as there isn't a big incentive to getting the ps5 ASAP, as there aren't many ps5 games out there yet. It's best to wait until the holidays because you aren't missing out on anything big yet. For now, people should probably prioritize getting the right 4k monitor to best suit the ps5.",46,english

WRONG!  It honestly doesn't even seem like it's that muchbetter than the PS4 Pro.  Sure.. it loads a lot faster but if that's the main reason you'rewanting to buy one then feel free.  The controller is also not what I was expecting.The analog sticks feel cheap and the size of the controller is a bit ridiculous.  I can seemaking it a little larger than the PS4 controllers but they made the controllers HUGE!Did I mention there's basically no games out for it yet?  So far I've been only playing myPS4 games like Rocket League and Rainbow 6 on it.  May I add these games are bothwell over half a decade old.  Instead of being mad that you didn't get a PS5 during thelaunch, JUST TAKE A DEEP BREATH and be thankful you didn't!  Give it a year or so andthen purchase one.  They'll surely drop down to $299 or at least a bit lower by that timeand at least there will be games available at that time.  With it's current price point of$499.99 (after tax and purchase of ONE controller we're talking $630 dollars.. you mayas well just spend a couple hundred more and get a PC that's twice as good as the PS5and will also open up thousands of games at your fingertips that are already out!Don't bother with the PS5 right now.  It's honestly not worth it.  To be quite honest, I haven'teven bothered playing it much since I got it a few days ago.  I've been playing Modern Warfareon my PC that has 10x better specs than the PS5 will EVER HAVE and my PC is already morethan 2 years old.  FACTS!",50,english

X,5,The Future Is Here,the United States ,20201114,True,"  Alright let me start off by saying that I’m probably not the only one who’s this excited about the PlayStation 5. And I’m sure a lot of you are anxious to own this bad boy and I gotta say once you get it, it’ll be worth the wait I promise you. I’m just so happy to finally get rid of my PlayStation 4 because im sure that a lot of you know how loud that thing was. But the PS5 is nothing like that. the most quietest console I’ve ever owned!!! The best part about owning this system is that, you don’t really need your PlayStation 4 because the ps4 is literally integrated into the PlayStation 5. You can download all your digital games for ps4 it’s literally right there in your library next to all your ps5 games you’ve purchased.The PlayStation Store:it is so much easier to get to and it’s much much much faster!!! you literally do not even have to load up the app anymore it’s all right there. There’s no need for loading screens. And I hated the PlayStation 4’s store it was super buggy and I did not like how it loaded sometimes because I’d have to restart the whole ps4 because of how slow it was and because it froze on me a lot.Your Library: as I’ve mentioned before all your games you’ve purchased on the PlayStation 4 it’s right there it is so easy to find and easier to download everything. I have not run into any issues and all my games are literally there ready for me to download and that’s exactly what I was hoping for and my dream came true!The Load Times:Ok we ARE LITERALLY IN THE FUTURE! My young self would’ve appreciated this very much! We’ve all been waiting for something like this for the longest time! And it is finally here. Who wants to sit and wait to game ? not me! As I’m sure a lot of you hate the waiting times during our long ps4 gaming sessions. I’m pretty sure we waisted a ton of hours just waiting for things to load. But it’s not like that for the PS5!!!! here are a few games I tested out that loaded so fast and one that really surprised me the most and it’s not even a PS5 game. Skyrim! Let me talk about this one for a second. This game is so fast I was a bit shocked. I downloaded it and soon after I opened the app and woah! it literally got me right into the main menu before I could even blink my eyes. and it took about 10 or less seconds to jump right into the game. That is very impressive! Spider-Man remaster edition barely noticed the loading screens that is how fast it is that I can’t remember how fast I jumped into the game and that is a good thing that I don’t remember because we all know how frustrating it is to want to game right away but the system we owned before the PlayStation 5 never let us have fun right away haha.Dualsense Controller:Ok guys I really mean it about us being in the future. We are in the future!!! this controller is. But heavy but it feels so good in my hands! It feels so much better than the ps4 controller. But enough about how good it feels in my hands haha. I love the haptic feedback i was playing Astro playroom and also I put on the pulse 3D audio headphones on and I was mind blown! it was the most amazing thing I’ve ever held in my hands this is something I never knew I needed but now I’m hooked and I don’t wanna go back to a plain “vibration” haha. I felt like I was in a spaceship playing with the controller and using the dual sense at the same time! I can sit here and talk about this controller but ima let you go try it out. Go to Best Buy or GameStop or where ever they have a demo for you to play with and see for yourselves it is the future guys it really is and I can only imagine what virtual reality will be like on the next PSVR.Is The PlayStation 5 Loud: That is a great question!Here’s a simple answer to that. NO!this system is super quiet. As I’ve mentioned before, this system is so quiet I can finally game all night if I wanted to not waking up and getting complaints from my family. when I owned the PlayStation 4 I hated how loud that it was yes it sounded like a jet was going off! and it was the most frustrating thing about owning the PS4. Sony really did an amazing job with the the PlayStation 5. No more do you have to worry about your console heating up on you and turning off on you and sounding like it’s going to break haha.I’ll edit more at another time once I’ve used the PS5 more.",22,english

Mike Capuano,5,"Glad to have it, but you MAY want to wait.",the United States ,20201116,True,"  As someone who likes to have the ""New Shiny"" as early as possible, I was very pleased that my PS5 arrived on release day! I have had a blast with it so far! Demon's Souls is a brilliant launch title, recapturing and improving upon the 2009 PS3 title. Miles Morales continues the magic from 2018's Spider-Man, in a shorter, but more focused campaign. But shockingly, the bundled-in Astro's Playroom is probably the most fun I have had with my new console! It oozes fun and charm and is simultaneously a love letter to all thing Playstation and also a thorough showcase of what the DualSense controller is capable of! For me, this purchase hit all the right notes, but I could definitely say that a large portion of gamers can probably wait to get one until there are a few more exlusives!",18,english
Chris,5,Unique design... interesting controller! Great system,the United States ,20201112,True,"  The console has a really unique design. It is also very large (larger than the original Xbox One). The controller feels very ergonomic and has a unique vibration system. You can feel the difference in materials that your character walks on in Astrobot (a free game pre-installed to the system!). At one point in Astrobot, my character turned into a spring and it actually felt like I was pressing a spring with the controller's triggers. I'm very excited to see where devs take this.My main complaint with the design is that there is piano gloss finish on the front. This wouldn't be much of an issue but there is a usb port in the center. This allow for the glossy finish to be scratched very easily. As much as I like piano gloss, I would have rather had a matte finish around the port.The UI is also great. It feels like they combined the best aspects of the PS4's interface.Overall, this is a very good console. I'm excited to see what devs do with it!",20,english
Phil,5,"Bulky, but Fantastic System And a Message to Stock Complainers.",the United States ,20201210,True,"  Very happy i managed to preorder one back in September and get it on launch day. My PS5 has been running perfectly so far. The new controller is the best Sony has ever produced, the new rumble features are cool...but it's the adaptive triggers i think will impress me more in the future. (if developers actually implement it)The system itself is VERY large and unfortunately needs the stand to even lay down horizontally because of it's weird shape. I really can't wait for the PS5 Slim that should be out in a few years. While it's a matter of opinion, the PS5 is overall an aesthetically ugly console, it's large and overally designed in my view. But i am overall bias towards simple designs. BUT, regardless of looks...it's a solid gaming system and i'm hyped for all those future exclusives!*TO THE PEOPLE COMPLAINING ABOUT STOCK*:To the people complaining about stock....honestly... just be patient. Eventually stock will be replenished and there will come a time when you'll be able to just walk into a GameStop or Bestbuy and get a PS5. (within the next few months most likely). Don't give scalpers your money over the hype of the system and the holidays, go get a Switch Lite and a bunch of games or something and ride it out. Distract yourself until availability returns to normal. ALSO, as someone with a PS5...there isn't really much to play on it at the moment either way (I'm mostly playing older PS4 games on it at the moment). And all the real big titles aren't out until 2021 and beyond anyways. So it's actually more lucrative to wait it out. The time will come, just like every other console that was hard to find at launch were they'll be commonly found everywhere in due time.Don't stress out over a gaming machine or pay double or more for a system that will most likely become available within a few months next year.",16,english
Stephen W. Jones,1,Bricked after 3 Hours of play!!!,the United States ,20201130,True,  Was playing for about 3 hours and when i cut the game off finally it never worked again. Had to contact Sony to get them to fix/replace it. In the process of sending it to them now. Good Luck on Launch consoles if you guys get one.,19,english

THE MASTER,2,Ps5 might be the buggiest launch console of all time.,the United States ,20201124,True,"  Everything seems to crash on this system. Call of duty crashes all the time. Playing zombies it crashed so hard the system shut off and have to rebuild the hd. Demons souls has crashed 2x on me so far. The actual o/s crashed just reading a message from someone. Fortnite crashed a few times as well. Checking the net, I am not alone. Seems like pretty much all the launch titles crash to some degree. Some more than others. Waiting to see if there are any updates soon. I fear the hardware might just be flawed.",15,english

Bagelz,5,Copy/Backup your Saved Data Now! (If you don't use cloud save),the United States ,20201114,True,"  Copy your Saved Game and Application Data over from PS4 to USB before it arrives or you will have to reconnect your PS4. This process took almost 30-45min because of how slow it was from the PS4. I could download a 30GB game faster than that. I've only had it for about 3 days now. So I will give my impression, rather than a full review as the condition of the product has not been tested for a sufficient length of time.First impressions:- It's big- Different look that I'm OK with but not crazy over.- The controller is the star of the show honestly. The increased grip size is very nice and new rumble haptic feedback upgrades are worthy of the Next Gen title.- 60FPS is the new Standard, If a game doesn't come out with a 60FPS mode AT least, I won't buy it.- 4k 60FPS is Excellent and the picture quality A1.- The Console is quite even with a CD inside. Unlike the wannabe Aircraft PS4Cons: Very Minor but noticeable during initial set up- The Stand, used when the PS5 is placed horizontally, easily pops off the frame when I try to move the system briefly or plug-in a USB to the font. Unlike the ps4 were I could just do those actions with one hand. I find the need to hold the PS5 down while I plug and unplug a USB. if I picked it up, the stand would dangle off occasionally.You honestly only notice it when doing larger movements. So after it's set up, you won't encounter that issue at all.",12,english
Chris O,1,Disaster,the United States ,20201113,False,"  The release is so unorganized, playstations are getting robbed by scalpers and being left no choice but to pay 1000 plus. At this point, no one can get a ps5. Terrible way to handle this for the loyal PlayStation fans.",39,english
The David,5,"Love my PS5, it's worthy of the hype!",the United States ,20201120,True,  Ignore all the low ratings from non-verified buyers. Stock was incredibly low and these consoles were near impossible to get.  People are rating out of rage instead of merit.I was lucky enough to score a Playstation 5 from Amazon on release day. I LOVE YOU AMAZON!!This system is a beautiful masterpiece. Everything is cleaners and smoother AND OH SO MUCH FASTER than the PS4. Games have NO load times. Example CoD Cold War to load a single player match of zombie mode took nearly 2 minutes for the PS4 version to load on my PS4 Pro. The PS5 version repeating the same process is literally 2.4  seconds to be ready to play. Even downloading games from PSN is much much faster.The only negative comment I can honestly make about the PS5 is the hard drive size. The wanted to make the system affordable and large SSD hard drives are very expense so they kept it under 1TB. As SSD prices fall in the future hopefully they release larger drives. PS4 games CAN be played now from external if you like. I installed multiple PS5 games and my most played PS4 and still have 200GB free so it's fine for the near future before juggling games becomes a thing.Currently 30 hours into Demon's Souls and so glad Amazon had stock on launch day!,10,english
G.T,3,No 1440p Resolution support,the United States ,20201112,True,"  Pretty cool console. Super fast, and graphics look decent.-The console has a weird clicky noise, not sure if that is normal or a potential future problem.-Also the lack of resolution 1440p is really annoying. Once Sony adds support for that I'll change my review.Overall it's an okay console, nothing crazy.",17,english

Aravind,5,Dual Sense controller is the game changer,the United States ,20201113,True,"  Goods:- The dual sense controller is the biggest highlight of the new console. The adaptive triggers and the newly reworked haptic feedback is a big game changer. Can't wait for the next gen games that exploit the capabilities.- LOAD TIMES!! just blazes through right into the game, no more progress bars. YAY!- Frame rates for existing ps4 are perceivably improved;- Ability to switch between fidelity and performance modes in games like MilesMorales are a welcome update.Bads:- SIZE: its hugggggeeee!!! and kinda ugly too; doesn't fit into the existing media cabinets; Not a good feel when are forced to hide your new toy behind the TV.- New dual sense controller being bigger takes a bit of time getting used to. Felt a bit of soreness in hand after about 4 hrs of gameplay.- There are no 4K 120 FPS games at launch. Don't rush to upgrade ur TV for HDMI 2.1 as yet.",9,english

SM,5,25 years later and PlayStation is still the best,the United States ,20201116,True,"  I really don't know what to say about the console. I'm sure most of you have seen and/or read about it by now.I'll just give my personal experience with it.-The CONSOLE looks okay. I'm sure most, like me, were disappointed with the black and white color scheme. However, you can try PlastiDrip (an aerosol spray) to give it a different color plastic coat (at your own risk, but should  be safe). I might try it .+The DUAL SENSE controller is actually pretty cool.  Upon hearing about it I thought it was extremely gimmicky.  Maybe it is, but it's actually a plus. It somehow makes you feel what you see in the game. It's one of those things you're just going to have to try for yourself. Do note, it might take a little getting used to. Playing BLACK OPS COLD WAR (online) for the first time with the DUAL SENSE took some time to adjust because of the triggers. Don't worry, you can disable the trigger pressure from the menu if you want to.+LOAD TIMES. Games load FAST. The only current downside of the SSD is the limited space. With roughly 600GB of usable disk space, you're going to have to be selective on what you have on your console's drive.+Games look gorgeous, especially if you have an excellent TV.-One thing I do not like is the console's MAIN MENU UI. It's currently not the best. You have to be navigating through a few menus and windows before you can execute your desired command. For example, on the PS4 you are able to double tap the PS button on the controller to switch between a game, the XMB, a video app, etc. On the PS5 you currently cannot do something similar to that. You have to press the PS button to find what you want to switch to. It's not a deal breaker, just a small annoyance that I hope Sony fixes. Personally I think the PS5's menu looks good, but it just needs a better navigation and shortcuts.-Another thing to note, I checked the Netflix and Disney+ app for DOLBY VISION. Neither apps had it. I did not try a 4K UHD Blu Ray for DV output. If I had to guess, it currently does not have it. Slight bummer.Overall, the PS5 is EXCELLENT, but you already knew that.P.S.  Do yourself a favor, PLAY ASTRO'S PLAYROOM (it's on your console already). It not only shows the Dual Sense's capabilities, but it also pays homage to PlayStation in the coolest and nostalgic way. It's a great experience.",8,english
Shef,5,PS5 is a Massive Beauty,the United States ,20201113,True,"  I got my PS5 on launch day admittedly due to great luck. It’s massive. About twice as heavy and large as the PS4 slim. I actually like the curve appeal so to speak. It can stand upright without a stand but requires a plastic attachment to sit on its side.Once turned on it was really easy to set up. The software guides you through everything and makes it easy to transfer your saves from PS4 if it’s also connected to your local network. The system was up and running in about fifteen minutes. It also was ready to play Assassins Creed Valhalla in about five minutes. I also downloaded God of War and Last of Us part 2 and both were ready to play in under ten minutes.The controller is my favorite part of the new system. It’s extremely comfortable to hold and is a logical evolution from the previous DualShock from PS4.Once I fired up ACV, the loading times were extremely fast and there were no issues loading textures. When starting a game from the hone screen for the first time, it takes about 30 seconds. From rest mode it’s even faster, maybe 10. If you die in game, or fast travel, the loading times are only a few seconds.Finally to turn the console off, you have to hit the PS button on the controller once to open a menu and the power button is all the way to the right. I preferred the old way better, but it’s easily fixed with a software update.Good luck getting your PS5! I don’t think you need one urgently given the lack of games, but I’m excited to play ACV and Cyberpunk on this new system.",8,english
David in FL,5,PS5: Next Generation Console Comes Through,the United States ,20201120,True,"  With these next gen console shortages everyone currently is experiencing, I am happy to say Amazon really came through.  I have been monitoring a number of sites over the past two weeks.  Thursday, around 9am ET, Amazon went live with another allotment.  I was lucky enough to grab one - website performance and speed was perfect - like any other purchase (unlike PS Direct, Walmart, GameStop, etc.).  Perhaps most surprisingly of all, it arrived SAME DAY.  I had it up and running by 9pm that same evening!First impressions:1.  Significant design improvement over the PS4.  Ventilation is vastly improved and is noticeably quieter, generating less heat.2.  Controller is world class.  Haptic feedback, adaptive triggers, audible responses, and sheer weight/feel of the controller is impressive.  Can't wait to see how games really take advantage of this with future titles.3.  User interface.  Much improved.  Menu graphics are sharper, overall more responsive.  I was never a fan of the PS3 & PS4 sterile menu system, this refined interface is a marked improvement.4. Day One Titles: Spiderman - great reference game to show off the console.  Demon Souls.  Wow.5. All my PS titles seem to work nicely (faster performance, usually).  Good backwards compatibility.6. Data transfer from PS4 to PS5 was simple and could be done in the background.Only real minor gripe is disk space.  These new next gen titles consume crazy amounts of disk space.  Plan on adding an external hard drive within 4 - 6 months of use, depending on your habits.  Sony could have done better in this area by enabling a second SSD at launch (The additional M.2 SSD slot is initially disabled and reserved for a future update). External drives work fine, just not as fast to load, etc.  (Pro tip, keep PS4 and older titles on the external drive.  Reserve newest titles for the built in ultra-high speed SSD).  Apparently no M.2 SSD manufacture can currently meet Sony's specs in terms of required performance, proper heatsink size, etc. to fit into the PS5.  Expectations this will get resolved in 2021.In summary, Sony did an impressive job with this new console.  You will be very pleased with the improvements. Stay vigilant with your search to obtain one.  A little extra monitoring of Amazon's PS5 console pages at the top of each hour might also prove useful.  :-)  You won't regret this purchase!",8,english

Lonnie J.,1,Disappointed,the United States ,20201114,False,  Disappointed. Been trying for days to buy this console and I’m sick of trying. At this point I give up.

Michael P. Oconnor,4,"I love the PS5, but it not perfect",the United States ,20201113,True,"  I got the PS5 yesterday, it is a great system, extremely fast, but it does have some issues, I do not like the new trophy interface I do not like, they took the card interface way to far there, the trophy as a list is still ok, you don't need every thing to be a ""card"" in the interface.Another issue, is they still don't have Bluetooth audio support for Bluetooth headsets need to use a USB to Bluetooth adapter.The only other issue is the sizeNow that I got the 3 bad things out of the way on to the good.But the load times are hyper fast, they are still there, but not as bad as they were on my PS4 Pro (even with a SATA SSD)  They still exist but it not as long as it was.The controller is comfortable.The graphics look better,Whisper quite even when deep in an action game.Setup and transfer of games/saves was very easy (you can use the PS app to sign into the console for the first time)I am looking forward to all the new exclusives that are to come out next year (especially The next Horizon Zero Dawn)I would love to give it 5 stars, but I really think the 3 issues, do pull half a star off, but I can not give 4.5 so I am forced to give it only 4, if they fix those 2 of those 3 issues I will update this and up it to 5.",7,english
Nathan Bertrand,5,Awesome Console!,the United States ,20201116,True,"  It's funny that all of the negative reviews on Amazon are from people who were not able to get the console on launch day. I understand that frustration, but I would encourage those people to vent these frustrations elsewhere as it's not an accurate depiction of the actual product. Supply chains and production have been seriously impacted this year and while I agree that Sony could have made more effort to dissuade bots and scalpers, it's worth it to just be patient.With that said, this thing is so fast and is overall great! I've only spent a few hours playing the console but it's been amazing so far. I can start it up from a full shut down and be playing Miles Morales within a minute. Literally.The only issue I have is that rest mode isn't working too well on my console. When it's in rest mode it makes a noise and gets a little warm...I don't really know why and maybe an update can fix that, but I'm not sure how that works. This is easily solved by just powering down my console when I'm done with it and it's relatively quiet when I'm actually playing it. With the fast start-up time, this isn't too inconvenient. But worth it to note!",9,english
tedleefontain,5,Can I rate this higher?,the United States ,20201112,True,"  Do you really need to read this? But I'll still say it. This is AMAZING, I have owned every console available. This is the biggest leap in ""next gen"" I've experienced. The jump from ps3 to ps4 was whatever, same with xbox 360 to xbox one. This... THIS, the controller is the most amazing thing. Spend a good amount of time playing astros playroom, it will show you how amazing the peice of tech your holding is. The controller is a huge step, I don't think xbox even attempted this. Not to mention the day tracing. A huge jump in graphics and realism. I was playing (watching) mile morales, there was a few times I had to remind myself it was a video game. Over all of the years, I could always tell it was a game, but it's getting to the point its a challenge now. Hands down my most favorite tech buy in the last 5 years, if not ever. If you can get it, don't hesitate, you won't regret it.",7,english
FrenchBulldozer,5,A Generational Leap,the United States ,20201209,True,"  I find it funny people are giving terrible reviews of a product they can't get their hands on. While I agree it's a frustrating situation, it's hardly a reflection of the product itself. That being said, I managed to secure a preorder back in September and it was delivered 8am launch day. I fired it up and downloaded the updates and purchased some digital content. While I'm going strictly digital this generation, I ended up getting the disc version just because. From the start it's an obvious evolution of the PlayStation console.PROS------- DualSense is a revolutionary input device, much like the N64 controller was. AstroBot is an incredible showcase- Faster and more responsive UI- Faster download speeds- PS4 games are optimized- Incredibly quietCONS------- Limited onboard storage (667GB usable), cannot offload or store to external device (yet).- Slightly buggy; froze a few times and scared the crap out of me. Weekly updates are promising.- Pretty massive in terms of size; may not fit in current entertainment systems- No VRR (yet)The system feels truly like an upgrade. Whereas my PS4 Pro would sound like an industrial fan when running Ghosts of Tsushima or Monster Hunter World requiring me to use headphones to drown out the noise, the PS5 maintains a nearly silent presence in my room. I really cannot wait for everyone to be able to get their hands on one and experience the system first hand. I feel your frustrations. I remember waiting 8 months to get my hands on thee PS3. Please be patient and don't fall prey to the scalpers.",6,english
elvin,5,"Great power for the price, very few flaws.",the United States ,20201123,True,"  I got this on release day.  The first notable thing you will notice is the size.  It IS big, but it is like that for a reason.  To keep it silent.  The console is very quiet.  You can really only hear it when a disc is being installed.  That is when the fans turn on a bit and the drive makes noise.  Anyways, I will list pros/cons.Cons:- Big(some don't care, and its size serves a purpose)- no VRR yet. (No variable refresh rate for games yet.  Sony said it is coming in a firmware update)- Cannot use PS4 controllers(a con to some, but the reason is that Sony went for innovation with the Dualsense.)- DualSense battery life - most report it at around 7-12 hours.  Sometimes lower, like in Astro bot which uses all features all the time mostly.  I wish the battery lasted longer overall.- Barebones UI compared to current PS4 UI - Lot of stuff has changed, like the quick access menu.  The display settings are not as extensive as the new Xbox also.  Lots of Apps are missing.  HDR always on, even in UI(you can turn it off completely if want though, but will also affect games).- No Internal or external storage expansion yet for PS5 games.  This is coming in a firmware update they say.There are other stuff too like no optical port, needing an adapter for VR, etc.  The ones I listed came to mind first.Pros:- Nearly 100% BC with PS4 games.  A lot have upgrades too.- Innovative controller - Haptic feedback/adaptive triggers/built-in mic/longer battery than DS4/etc.  The controller is awesome battery life aside.- Better First-Party than Xbox.  Xbox has Halo/Gears/Forza/Fable, what else?  They bought Bethesda, but it will be years before those games are released.  Then there is the fact that even Bethesda said they might appear on other consoles.  PS is known for its great first-party games.  Gran Turismo/God of War/The Last of Us/Spider-Man/KillZone/Uncharted/etc.- Very Quiet.  It is large, but the good thing is that it is super quiet.- Official internal storage expansion.  When it is updated you will be able to upgrade to higher memory storage.  The greater thing is that third-party drives will work.- Much faster internet speeds than PS4.  It is not even comparable.- 3d audio - sounds great.  Much better than what we had on PS4.Much much more that I will not go into since most people know a lof it.  I focused on the cons for those in doubt about their purchase.",6,english
snapple,5,Worth the Wait...but don't Sweat It.,the United States ,20201130,True,"  The system is what you expect in NEXT GEN. The haptic controller is something to experience, reminds of the first Wii experience. However, Spidey feels like DLC and Demons is a remake. There really is NO game on the market worth the hassle and price to get this unit RIGHT NOW. Don't overpay, be patient and wait for the games to arrive.Also, I'd recommend the digital version as the disc drive is rather loud. Louder than PS4.",8,english
nojtek,5,So far So good,the United States ,20201113,True,"  Received my console yesterday from Amazon pre-order, which despite getting e-mails after the purchase stating it may not arrive release date, to my surprised did. I realize that won't be the case for everyone, but it was a pleasant surprise.The console itself is a giant amongst consoles, as seen in any video about the console. The disc drive, confusingly to me, is on the bottom part of the console under the lip. Initially I set it up upside down and got an error when I put the disc in upside down. So far mine hasn't put off too many loud noises. At one point the disc drive sounded a little loud, but was not too bad. Initially after the setup, going through the menus right after, there did seem to be some kind of lag from something installing in the background that gave me the impression that it was locked up. I did end up rebooting it and the sluggishness continued, but when I came back later, about 10 minutes it was acting normal.The controller is awesome. I do miss the size and feel of the PS4 controller but some of the things that developers will be able to implement should be exciting, should they choose to take full advantage of the technology. The best way to get an idea of its capabilities is Astros Playroom which comes preloaded. It gives you an idea of the possibilities for the tech. I had read up on the Dualsense and was not too surprised by that, but what did surprise me was the haptic triggers. The pressure needed to press the triggers can change depending on the game setting. During the demo it almost felt as if something was keeping it from being pressed and then after went back to normal. This was crazy to me as it was my first experience with these kind of triggers. The controller also comes USB-C which is refreshing as well as the standard built in battery.The installation is just like the previous generations. Two prong power cable and HDMI. I've read that if you have a new (2019-2020) TV with HDMI 2.1 to make sure and use the cable supplied or a 2.1 HDMI cable. Some reports are coming in of black screens when powering up the console. I don't have a newer TV like this so my old cable worked just fine with no issues. Again, it seems to only be if your TV supports HDMI 2.1.I bought my console with Demon Souls and Assassins Creed Valhalla. Demon Souls is a very good looking game and Valhalla looks about like the current gen games. Judging on these games alone, it doesn't feel completely next gen, but that's to be expected during the early life of the console. For me the controller is what actually feels net generation. These feels just like the PS4 at launch, sort of a mid generation console until developers really start taking advantage of the hardware.Overall for the price and what I received, I give it 5 starts. It helps that the hard drive and disc drive on my launch PS4 are going out right as this is coming out. Also with the backwards compatibility with PS4 games makes it worth it to me.",6,english
Hendo,5,Is it time to purchase a Next-Gen Console?,the United States ,20201113,True,"  In a word, absolutely. I got into the PS4 game later into the console’s lifespan even though I never even touched most of the first-party lineup of titles. This time around, there’s all of the under the hood improvements to enjoy right now, as well as a pretty highly-anticipated roster of games due out in 2021. If you’ve got plenty of mileage out of your PS4, or don’t own one at all, the PS5 brings so much to the table and makes a great first impression.Better graphics, responsiveness, an enhanced controller experience, and all of the other improvements might not be massive in their own right. But together they form a clear picture of what the next-generation console experience will look like. And I have to say, I’m impressed.",6,english
Review Bits,5,Beautiful console with few downsides (4.5 Rounded Up),the United States ,20201115,True,"  So far there's been quite a bit to love about this console with a few small drawbacks. The experience we've had with this console has felt fully next gen and that's coming from a multi-platform gamer with a fully upgraded PC. This review is broken up into the following sections:CONSOLE DESIGN---------------------The internet was filled with an ocean of memes after the final unveiling of the PS5's design. Seto Kaiba and Doug Dimmadome was two of the most apt and hilarious, and the consensus was that this console looked pretty peculiar. Different from the norm for sure. I'll admit that I scratched my head for a good while as I have with a lot of the other modern, bombastic, and overly complicated modern designs that tend be more present in newer gen cars.Sometimes they take a while to look at and get used to before you see what the artist was going for, other times (like with the new Nissan Maxima) you still cringe every time you pass by it on the road and wonder what they were thinking. Sony was venturing into that same design territory which definitely isn’t typical for consoles. Luckily I’ve grown to love it after having it in my living room for a few days and mounting it sideways. It almost feels like a sculpture or a super-modern accent to your entertainment center.Cooling is another piece of why the console was designed the way it was. The cooling in it seems to work extremely well but it still falls prey to the same issues the PS4 pro did when it comes to keeping it in enclosed areas, though not to the same extent. As consoles tend to become more powerful and the design tends to lean closer PC’s, ventilation and airflow will continue to be an issue unless alternatives are pursued.Overall the design is risky and ambitious, yet not without purpose, and works well. It makes the console almost feel like a piece of modern artwork in your living room. Very cool.HARDWARE & PERFORMANCE-----------------------------------This console is a beast, and as multi-platform gamer with an overpowered PC, trust that I don’t say that lightly. Every console generation has upgraded processors, GPUs, and storage, but one of the unique aspects of this generation was the introduction of SSDs. The general concepts of SSDs isn’t new to most PC users but what’s different for consoles is that the architecture and having them as a standard form factor on a platform. We haven’t seen their full potential used on PCs yet largely because not everyone has them and even if they do, not everyone installs games on them so developers don’t count on that. On the PS5 we now get to fully feel the power of games utilizing this tech to improve load times and also to expand the concept of game design.Due to improved performance and instant loading of assets, developers no longer have to rely on tricks to hide level loading from the player’s view, and other FOV objects shift instantly with almost no performance issues or lagging. It’s absolutely incredible to experience in action and really helps to make more beautiful, engaging, and next gen experiences that would be incredibly difficult to experience even on PC. The performance on this console is also some of the best value for the price compared to PCs as well and doesn’t seem like it will feel antiquated as fast as consoles normally start to.Also worth mentioning is that the PS5 has the ability to play 4K UltraHD Blu-ray discs which is incredible. In the past several years I've had no desire to fork out money for one since the few 4K blu-ray steelbook movies I've bought have the ability to also be downloaded in 4K UltraHD.CONTROLLER------------------The new dual sense controller is one of the greatest features of this platform. With vastly improved haptic motors, it improves the player’s sense of immersion with the games that they’re playing. Astro’s Playroom does a great job of showcasing the various ways that players will experience it in future games while also serving as a great little game itself. You can feel a variety of textures, toughness on triggers, etc. in a variety of environments and conditions. It’s really cool technology and could even adjust game difficulty or mechanics in a really creative and exciting way. It’s likely the biggest improvement in this technology since rumble packs started being built directly into controllers and it’s one of the standout features of the PS5.The overall design of the controller is mostly the same but also feels different as you begin to increasingly notice the small changes. An immediately noticeable change is to the controller's styling. It's now fitted with a really cool two-tone aesthetic to match the console. The controller is now slightly bigger but feels a lot nicer and full to the grip. You'll also notice that the big blinding LED on the back has been removed and replaced with a sleek LED around the edges of the keyboard button. A nice flourish is the texture to the bottom. If you look closely enough you'll notice that those aren’t tiny dots – they’re tiny, microscopic triangles, O’s, squares, and X’s floating around which is absolutely crazy.UI/OS--------As generations move forward and the UI has become closer to perfection, expect fewer leaps. The UI is mostly the same as with the PS4 but with a few flourishes. The menu bar is a lot easier to access with just a mere tap of the PS button on your controller. The initial loading screen up bootup has some really cool effects, and menus are slightly more organized and easier to navigate. The overall design is a bit cleaner and more refined. Overall a great presentation with not a whole lot to complain about other than the confusing choices they made with the display order of the “Friends” menu. I don’t understand why I have to scroll to the bottom to see friends online. Why.LAUNCH LINEUP----------------------The launch lineup is extremely solid. Demon’s Souls and Spiderman Miles Morales Ultimate Launch edition are two of the best launch titles ever released, and Godfall is another decent exclusive. Additionally available are a few multi-platform staples like NBA 2k21, Madden, and Call of Duty. Overall a great launch line up that will give players plenty to do. There’s also a lot to explore in the PSPlus store, which is great because those titles are available to install and play on PS5 as well. Also included for free is Astro's Playroom which is meant to serve as a tech demo of the console's features but ends up feeling like a solid game and homage to PlayStation history.HARD DRIVE/STORAGE------------Storage space isn’t the greatest. The new SSD’s NVMe drive performance is phenomenal but also makes storage space more expensive. The PS5 has 825GB total with only 667.2GB available for games, which may be unmanageable for anyone moving over from their PS4. Luckily PS4 games can be stored and played via an external hard drive. PS5 games, however, can’t be accessed via external hard drives since their functionality relies on them being accessed through a high speed, NVMe SSD. Thankfully players won’t need to worry about that just yet given the limited number of PS5 titles at launch. Sony’s planning on making hard drive upgrades available through a future update. Those upgrades will need to be Sony certified NVMe solid state drives with 5.5GB/s read speeds or higher. It’s a bittersweet categoryBRANDING/PACKAGING----------------------------This is one area where the PS5 feels slightly uninspired. Sony's slowly been moving further in the clean, futuristic/minimalist style, which previous generations have benefited from. Unfortunately it's starting to feel slightly stale and uninspired. The game cases use the same exact blue cases that PS4 games use and the case art design is almost completely unchanged with the exception of the colors. The console packaging feels really basic and minimalist too to the point where is sits on the edge of feeling like little effort was made, almost like this is yet another console being cranked out of the Sony machine. It's hard to feel like this is a strong suit especially when looking into how much effort Microsoft put into the Xbox Series X's packaging. Luckily the PS5 makes up for this in other areas.BUGS-------There have been a slew of bugs reported by other outlets. For us, the only issue we've experienced was with the initial attempt at transferring the data. The first attempt failed (partially? it wasn't quite clear) but the second attempt at copying data over succeeded. It's unfortunate that PSN accounts are required to transfer users over from PS4 so my girlfriend's local account couldn't be transferred.============BOTTOM LINE-----------------The PS5 has a few small hiccups but is a really outstanding consoles with some really cool features that set it apart from pervious generations and current gen alternatives. As more generations of consoles are released and fewer improvements are left to be made conceptually, it’s slowly becoming difficult for anyone other than Nintendo to avoid feel stale or like another lineup in the large industry machine. Luckily new haptic technology, a bold new design, meaningful use of SSD technology, 3D sound, and cool tweaks to the existing Sony formula help set this console apart and feel even more exciting than the PS4 did initially in some ways. The level of backward compatibility so far is also extremely impressive and being able to play 4K bluray is a nice feature to have. It would’ve been nice to see cool new branding and cool new game cases, but you can’t have it all.",5,english
RunnerKim,5,Five Stars!,the United States ,20201124,True,"  I want to start out with pure transparency, I felt like I won the lottery when I was miraculously able to purchase the PS5 console on 11/12.  (It's been two weeks and I still can't believe it.) After spending the entire day cycling through every website that I could find that claimed they'd have inventory, I hit the Amazon page at the right split-second at 9:00PM. A few tears of joy may have been shed.It arrived on 11/14 and I haven't used my television since. My teen is constantly screaming things like ""LOOK HOW FREAKING FAST THAT JUST LOADED!"" or shoving the remote in my hand and forcing me to experience the ""incredible haptic feedback!"" for myself and endlessly carrying on about amazing frame-rates.  I don't know a frame rate from a bucket of mud, but my kid is thrilled...I was kidding, I actually HAVE watched tv with the new console and the available apps are very cool. We were able to get some new ones that our older smart-tv no longer supported, so that was nice. And it's true, everything does load lightning fast. So far it doesn't support streaming from our personal home server and that is a negative.I realize that most people were not lucky (I know it was luck and no skill on my part!) like I was on the 12th and I agree, this was a TERRIBLE roll-out that neither SONY nor any of the retailers handled well. There is no excuse for how poorly it was orchestrated. I understand the rage. Having said all that, although the console is ugly in my opinion, it is a fantastic gaming system. My teen obsessively researched the PS5 for the past six months and he has not been disappointed with it.  GOOD LUCK TO YOU IN YOUR PS5 PURSUIT!!!",5,english
Mosep,2,Worst release ever. Unavoidable updates.,the United States ,20210103,True,"  1) The buying experience was the worst ever.No exaggeration, I've wasted 12hrs in the last 3 months (since Sept pre-order) on constantly crashing, never ending recaptcha (which is obnoxious in normal circumstances) loops.My opinion of Sony in general is *drastically* lower after this fiasco.THIS was literally the best way to distribute they could think of? Tens of millions of people wasting their lives on crashing websites for hours at a time.Asinine.2) Same as before, there is literally NO WAY to turn off automatic updates.  Oh, there are options to change, they just have no effect.I am on cell phone Internet only and have to travel to Wi-Fi for any significant updates.So the FIRST thing I did when I got ps5, was turn off every sort of download.I set up everything and downloaded all updates, by arrangement, with Wi-Fi.Yet tonight, I connect to my hotspot and a game I had installed from disc runs a 43Gb update.Assholes.Why even have the settings to turn off automatic updates if they don't do anything?Hopefully the cell carrier will let me adjust for this month or something instead of charging the $10/2gb over plan.While I despise every. single. effing. thing. about my PS5 experience up to this point.I can only assume it's going to be the same high quality console, that keeps being impressive for a decade like ps3 & ps4.",5,english
André,5,Feeling very lucky to have gotten a pre-order — amazing console!,the United States ,20201113,True,"  So let me start by saying that I fully acknowledge why so many people are upset. I have friends that have been trying to gain access to the pre-order for weeks and now just the regular release with no luck. Poorly communicated release dates/times, bad website experiences, server issues — pretty terrible. I got very lucky and was able to snag one before they sold out — I feel incredibly privileged and would be quite upset if I was on the other side of the fence.All of that being said, I now have the console all set up with my current games and have had a day to experience some of the new features. Loading time is down significantly from PS4, new UI is pretty intuitive(feels more practical and less intrusive when in game), controller is a huge step up in terms of experience — I would say the controller is the clear differentiator between the PS5 vs. PS4. Adaptive triggers feel great and are a super fascinating hardware feature for this console. Exiting to see how game devs will use this hardware.The unit itself is not very attractive in my opinion. It's a bit of an eyesore compared to the PS4, but that's just my preference. Significantly bigger than the PS4, so make sure you have room to store it.Overall very happy with the purchase and I'm excited to try some games other than Astro Bot that utilize the PS5's new features.",5,english
Angel N.,5,"Low reviews are people who couldn't get a PS5, no bearing on the product itself.",the United States ,20201116,True,"  The PS5 really is next gen gaming. I somehow got lucky and placed my order in the small window of time that Amazon had them up, received my order on launch day.It stands to say launch consoles have issues so please try not to put your PS5 into rest mode with Spiderman Remastered until they put out a patch.The PS5 itself is massive but setup is just as easy as it's always been. Loading times are ridiculously fast but there's no approved external hard drive so my old games have taken up a lot of space on my disk version.As for the people leaving negative reviews asking Amazon and playstation why they didn't produce or release enough products, Nintendo Switch also ran out. There were shipping restrictions to and from China not only because of politics but also from COVID. They will release copious amounts of them as soon as they have them so just be patient or switch to another platform. The demand is too high for certain products and sometimes supply just cannot catch up.",5,english
Darkmane,5,The Real Next Gen Console,the United States ,20210111,True,"  Why Should you buy a PS5?If you don't have a PC, this is a must buy and delivers the best price for graphics.If you have a PC, buy a PS5 for the amazing exclusives that Sony will surely deliver, and to play the older gen titles such as GoW, HZD, Bloodbourne etc etc in 4k 60fps. Additionally the controller's dual sense technology is simply amazing and something that has HUGE potential if utilized properly.What are some things you will love about the PS5?Extremely easy to transfer your PS4 games to PS5. You can directly connect PS4 external storage and the games will work. You can also connect both PS4 and PS5 over WiFi+Ethernet cable and have all the games transferred within the hour.Download speeds are much much much better.Huge difference in the responsive of the controller. It just works better than the DS4 on PS4 games.The haptic feedback and triggers are absolutely absolutely crazy. A lot has already been said but some examples are: The controller will provide feedback so it will feel like you are in water when walking in water, when are walking on a glass surface or on a metal surface etc etc.Another example is in Astrobot, when you are ""carrying"" many bouncy balls and you could feel the bouncy balls rolling inside the controller.There is just no way to explain it in words. You have to experience it.The controller's built in mic is REALLY good and has excellent noise cancellation.PS Plus Collection is a great add on to get started and gives you around 20 ""old-gen"" games FOR FREE.What are some things you wont like about the PS5?The size.Very few ""next-gen"" games available at launch.The UI and menu while its pretty fast and responsive lacks features. Powering down, changing sound output, finding games requires several button presses and can feel like a hassle compared to PS4's ""quick menu"".",4,english
Erik Nerheim,1,Your basic glitchy trash. You can't update games without an error,the United States ,20201214,True,"  And so much more. I am angry at sony this system barely works. All my effort wasted getting this garbage. I'm not going to get into all the errors for demon's souls, Assassin's creed valhalla and Miles Morales it would take all day. Hopefully the next 5 times per month 876mb system updates will actually address issues and not just eat up my satellite data.",7,english
Calvin,5,PS5 Mind-blowing...Amazon Exceeds Expectations!,the United States ,20201113,True,"  First, I'd like to express how great a job Amazon did with my pre-order. I was a little hesitant to do a pre-order from an online store at first but I ran out of options as Best Buy had technical issues and Target sold out immediately. The Amazon site had no hiccups or crashes. I put the PS5 in cart and checked out with no issues. I got confirmation that my order was received and it was done. I saw many people on social media complaining about how they couldn't get their orders in from other stores but I had no issues. Fast forward to a week before launch day, my order status was still show no estimated delivery yet and I began to worry that I'd have delays. I had heard that Amazon sent emails to a few customers stating that they might get their orders on launch day so I was worried I'd be one of those since my order status hadn't changed. Then finally the day before launch day I get an email saying my order was shipped! The morning of launch day, I went to track my order and not only did it give me an estimated delivery time,  but it had a live tracker of where my package was on a map and how many stops the driver had before delivery mine. I had never seen or heard of such an informative tracking system until now. And there I was hanging out of my blinds, phone in hand like a kid on Christmas morning waiting to take delivery of my PS5! Of course the package came in secure and undamaged. I had to shout out Amazon for what turned out to be the best online shopping, and pre-order, experience I had ever gone through!The PS5 so far has blown my mind! Yes, the graphics and game performance are much improved over last gen, but the UI is very sleek and lightning fast! Everything moves so fast, downloads happens almost instantaneously, and there are no lags in navigating the UI. Performance may be very comparable to the xBox Series X, but the Dual Sense controller is what sets the 2 apart. Very pleased with Sony for this piece of tech. It is very Nintendo-esque.Overall, very happy with the entire transaction and product. Amazon, you did it again!",6,english
Troi,3,It's a new console alright...,the United States ,20201126,True,"  The good: First off, super glad I got the disc version. It does take all of my PS4 games and I haven't had a single problem with any of them playing. I do like the preloaded Astroboy game which helps explain the new features of the dual sense remotes by taking you through a super mario style game. I also like that you can lay the PS5 down or stand it up (if you have room!) and it comes with a little stand to make sure you have appropriate airflow. The outside white plates are easily removed for custom designing.The bad: The design just sucks IMO. It looks like Sony tried to take a wifi router and cross it with an xbox. I also find the height of the PS5 to be problematic in fitting in my usual entertainment places. There are several bugs reported which I have experienced two errors myself. The front USB outlet on the PS5 is NOT chargining the controllers. It doesn't matter if it's in rest mode or plugged in during play. There is power going to it according to the light change and I've been able to update the remote through the USB. The controller also had a tendency to lag after several hours of play.  I've noticed after pressing a button there is no response and if you press it again it will finally register the first button push. This has occurred with the directional arrow buttons and the shape buttons of the controller that came with the console and on a second controller that I bought separately. The only way to fix it seems to be to plug it back into the USB, unplug it, and play with the second remote for a little bit then switch back. The voice assistant is annoying and Sony makes harder than it needs to be just to find where to disable it. If the voice only said menu titles then it would be fine but it reads every little detail including ""to access press x"" etc. The lack of themes is also annoying as I have several limited edition themes only my PS4 that can't carry over. The main menu is always showing reels of people's shared games which I find to be useless. It would be nice if the main menu was actually the games installed instead of having to shift all the way to the end to look at your entire game library (the game switcher shortcut only shows recently played games).Basically, yes it's a new console with all the flashy bells and whistles but also a lot of bugs that need fixing. I know remembered why I tend not to buy new consoles on release day!",4,english
Dr.P,5,Very fast,the United States ,20201210,True,"  Excellent loading time of games and apps. Only about 5 games available for it so far. Graphics are not all that better than my original PS4, even with a TV that does 60fps and HDR. The menu isn't as convenient as the PS4's. The white color really sticks out in the room, which may be good or bad depending on your preference. For me, it doesn't match anything in my room or entertainment center. The PS5 has had a lot of crashing problems on release, whereas my Xbox Series X hasn't. A lot about the PS5 seems rushed in development to me. The Astrobot game it comes with however is a really nice game with impressive graphics and controls showing off the new controller, better than most of the games you can buy for it on release, so that was  really nice surprise.",5,english
Badoobie,4,"Rough launch, HARMONY remote instructions!",the United States ,20201117,True,"  Updated 11/19 w/harmony remote details!I was honestly happy just to be able to buy the system at all. So many people have not been able to get one. My first impression was that it's big, but not ridiculously big. It reminds me a bit of my launch PS3. It's a LITTLE bigger but not much. It's significantly larger than my ps4 pro.Anyway, who cares about size! It's fast. The setup was relatively painless and I was able to migrate my data from my ps4 and hook up the external 4tb drive to the ps5. Any games you have discs for won't show as installed (shows as error) even if they were on the external hard drive. Oddly, death stranding downloaded even though I don't own it digitally...I wish that game wasn't awful, I might have played it...but the weird bottled babies and running around like a post apocalyptic FedEx man while attacking monsters with weapons made out of your excrement is just too weird for me.Astro's Playground is fun and really shows off the dual sense controller. I also bought the new spider-man game. It's not as good as the original, and it has crashed 3 times on my system so far with maybe 4-5 hours of gameplay. The first crash required that I physically power down the whole system by holding the power button for like 15 seconds. Then I got all the errors about shutting down incorrectly and needing to repair my external drive etc. Kinda unnerving for a first party title.The system is quiet which I'm thankful for...the ps4 pro sounds like a jet engine when it's under load. It also doesn't remotely go with the asthetic that I have, but that's a first world problem. Speaking of, it also doesn't work with the Logitech Harmony Remotes...I have the ultimate with hub and it just shows up as an uncontrollable device. Hopefully that will be addressed or I'll have to pick up that PDP IR thing for the ps4 that people say works with ps5.Anyway, I'm sure over time the glitches and stuff will be worked out. It's fast and games look good. Maybe because I'm coming from a ps4 pro that upscaled to 4k it doesn't seem like a huge jump in fidelity, but honestly the games don't seem any different to me as a casual gamer. Textures are a little better. Lighting is a little better. But it's not a leap like snes to n64 or even ps1 to ps2. This is more subtle, but the quality of life change with a quieter system and faster load times is welcome.UPDATE: So spider-man crashes A LOT and I've also had a couple issues with the controller not powering on the PS5 without having to manually power the system off with the front button and then try again from the controller. It's pretty obvious we're beta testing this hardware for Sony. It's a little discouraging for $500 but it is what it is.I experimented a bit with my Harmony Remote (hub version) and found that you can pair the PS5 as a PS4 as a stop gap until Logitech officially supports the PS5. So add a device, select PS4, follow the instructions for pairing. It works fine as of 11/19/2020. The shutdown sequence is obviously different now and I'll detail how I got it working below. The way you change the shutdown macro is by going into the harmony app on your phone, go to harmony setup. Then select add or edit devices/activities. Once it's connected to your hub you should be able to go into ""Devices"" and find your PS5 (which will be labeled PS4, but you can change that if you prefer). Then go into power options and keep clicking next until you get to the option with Power On & Power Off. Select Power Off and setup the following:If you prefer Power OFF mode:PS - 0 secondsDelay - 1 secondDirectionDown - 0.5 secondsDirectionRight - 2 secondsCross - 0 secondsDelay - 1 secondDirectionDown - 0 secondsDelay - 1 secondCross - 0 secondsOr if you are comfortable with Rest Mode considering the issues:PS - 0 secondsDelay - 1 secondDirectionDown - 0.5 secondsDirectionRight - 2 secondsCross - 0 secondsDelay - 1 secondCross - 0 secondsYou will probably also have to go into Power On options (keep in mind Harmony remote won't power on your PS5) and add something to that in order for the app to let you save the power on/off macro settings.  I just added PS button for 0 seconds. It doesn't cause the remote to hang during power on so it's fine.Hopefully this will help someone to not have to go through as much trial and error as I did. Good luck!",4,english
Eric Smith,1,Why even release online only so scammers with bots can buy all of them and resale,the United States ,20201113,False,  Why even release a console with limited availability to let all the scammers with bots buy them up for resale.,32,english

NikoB,1,Sony Knew Demand was High,the United States ,20201115,False,  Sony knew demand was high they do this everytime this ceo needs to get the production team on point this is ridiculous its almost impossible to beat the bots.. there should be 3 to 5 even 10 times made and sent out for everyone they had months to get it right.. they do this everytime like people never learn in life it sucks,28,english
David R,1,ghost console,the United States ,20201113,False,"  Worst console release yet. Tech companies, like Sony in this case, have to figure out how to  release a product without mass scalping. Until then, enjoy the one star review.",30,english

TJ,5,The definitive next gen console,the United States ,20201117,True,"  If you’re stuck between an Xbox or PlayStation, I’ll say this. Out of the two, the Series X and PS5, I’ve found the PlayStation to be the most true next gen experience out of the pair. It’s sleek, quick, snappy and clean. Yes, the actual physical  console does take a bit to get used to. It’s known to be a polarizing design, but after a few days it does grow on you. Did for myself anyways. —- Now when it comes to the rest, it does have the killer apps, only playable on PlayStation. From Demon’s Souls, to Spider-Man’s spin off, to Sackboy. All top notch, high quality games. Each of which takes high advantage of the hardware baked into the console. Loading times? Mostly eliminated. You jump right into games without a hefty waiting period. Levels and zones load in seamlessly and in the blink of an eye. Not to mention the new graphical enhancements from the new GPU. These new games truly show off how PS5 only gets better from here on out.Then you have the UI. It’s an innovative advancement of the PS4’s with a few more bells and whistles. It really helps bring home the “this is next gen” feeling. There’s nothing like exploring a new user interface when you get a new console. This is a different approach than Xbox, who kept the UI the same between generations for inter connectivity of the Xbox ecosystem. That makes the jump on the PlayStation UI side feels even bigger. All in good ways.Finally, DualSense. This controller is the secret ingredient to truly deliver each player into the future of gaming. It’s not gimmicky like some Nintendo features, not at all. But instead it feels sophisticated and it’s one of those features you will only hope most developers adopt on the 3rd party side. Time will tell, but we have seen it with the new COD on top of the Sony published titles. So that’s a start!Overall, if you’re interested and if you can manage to get one of these immersive, innovated and generation leaping machines, then do so. You won’t be disappointed. Full 5/5 for me.",4,english
Gamer4Life137,5,Big Chungus,the United States ,20201112,True,"  The PS5 is massive. Just up front, make sure to clear some space, then clear some extra space on top of that.That being said, this console is exceptional. Experiencing true 4K with HDR and ray tracing is just unbelievable. Guys, next gen is here.Worth noting that VRR (variable refresh rate) is not currently supported despite it having been listed as a feature. Hope it comes in a patch soon.I also did experience a system crash already. (currently still day 1). The system does need a stability patch, but it's performing well given it is the first day.Would definitely recommend.",4,english
Shawn Tyner,5,Playstation5,the United States ,20201117,True,"  AMAZON!!!! Thank you for allowing me to snag a Playstation5 from you guys!! I was really trying so hard to find one of these gaming consoles. Walmart was a waste of my time trying to get an online order, what a joke! AMAZON notified me like they said that they would when the item came back available and it was put back in my cart for fast purchasing. Thank you again AMAZON!!!!! Playstation5 works great no issues so far. Very happy with my purchase!!!",5,english
Reggie,4,The Future of Gaming Arrives,the United States ,20201122,True,"  Observations after roughly one week of owning the PS5:- Can use my Sony TV remote to pause/play movies and control subtitles on the PS5- Disc is hot after running a 4K blu-ray movie (watching in roughly 30min to one hour spurts of the Harry Potter collection currently)- Dolby Vision is not supported- Startup time for games: 5-10 seconds from inserting the disc; usually, 5 seconds or less to load a game after reaching the title screen- Demon's Souls crashed twice in the Nexus shortly after loading the game so far; patch installed a few days ago, no crashes since then.  (rare) slight stuttering of 60 FPS framerate in certain areas.  game froze a couple of times on me in random areas with no enemies around.- Spiderman Miles Morales runs flawlessly so far with 0 crashes or freezes- NBA2k21: wow, words do not do the game justice in terms of realism other than a few obviously off parts: for instance, LeBron doing a shoulder shimmy celebration after dunking on someone (never seen him do this as a Laker)- Closing game through the PS5 app switcher and removing the disc before entering rest mode each day; no SSD corruption or rebuild issues thus far (fortunately) after multiple system updates.",3,english
MidwestMom,1,Don't but,the United States ,20210105,True,  It didn't work right out of the box. It has to go to PlayStation to see if they can fix it. It will probably be a month or more before we know if they'll replace it or fix it. I wish I had never bought it. My son is super upset.,7,english
Phylicia04,5,Easy purchase!,the United States ,20201125,True,"  I can’t believe how easy this was for me to purchase. I had set ‘in stock notifications’ a few weeks before the launch and I was making dinner and got a notification on my phone around 6pm. Checked, it was in stock, swipe, click, here in two days!",7,english
James,2,Wait to buy,the United States ,20201119,True,  A ton of bugs doesn't work half the time other half its crashing after a few minutes you should wait till Sony fixes its software issues until then its basically a ps4 pro because ps4 games are the only things working right,9,english
Steve Lowder,1,Totally Disappointing,the United States ,20201114,False,  Totally disappointed with Sony and the failure to even come close to releasing enough units to support the demand. Every console release has been the same thing. It is not news to them. I am so sick of these tactics to produce hype and news to generate future sales.I also don understand why we are not able to still purchase the system at this time and get one sent as soon as it is in stock so  don't have to keep checking and checking.,27,english
Jessica N. Pham,1,NOT WORTH THE HYPE,the United States ,20210112,True,  Spent so much on this machine only to be let down. The console is nicely packaged and is sleek but the contents that are available for this is very lack luster. I paid hundreds of dollars for a system that has only produced a handful of new games. The games themselves cost over 60 dollars a piece as well. Sony took several years to produce this machinery and rushed it to production to compete but lacked on the sustenance.,4,english
LoneWolf22,5,High Stress and terrible bots....,the United States ,20201115,True,"  First, I would like to say that it feels surreal to have been able to purchase a PS5 on launch day. I checked and checked obsessively only to get ""Out of Stock"" at the order review section. Not necessarily Amazon, but other sites. The whole reveal/pre-order was a debacle. Sloppy, sloppy sloppy. Thankfully, Amazon came through with their notification and it went through smoothly. Maybe its because everyone was focused on the Walmart promotion? Either way, glad it was the actual product.In terms of the system itself, it so quiet! I had it on all night (transferring PS4 data). My fan made more noise than this. The unit is HUGE. I had to clear out a section of my setup. My photo isn't doing this justice but if you look closely, the inside has small white playstion controller shape () details , which is awesome. The controller, WOW. Using it makes you feel like you're in the game. Although, it's only been 24 hours, I've been impressed so far. The only complaint so far is the travesty and headaches of trying to get ahead of the bots....",3,english
Brian Y,5,"The console is amazing, and the ordering process was easy per usual",the United States ,20201115,True,"  Was able to pre-order on the 1st day, was nervous due to all the pre-order issues happening EVERYWHERE, but just like my PS4 ordered from Amazon, the delivery was completed without a hitch. I know people are upset they couldn't get one, but it's not Amazon's fault, and largely not even Sony's fault, they had and sold more pre-order inventory than the PS4, one of the top selling consoles of all time, during a pandemic. Everyone who wants one will eventually get one, no need to review bomb for not getting one at launch.Now for the consoles. It's GREAT. Only a couple minor issues, which are widespread and will be fixed with an update. I'm coming from the OG PS4 so being able to take full advantage of my TV, plus the power of the PS5 has been amazing. The dual sense controller has to be used to truly understand the hype, which it actually exceeded for me. Yes the console is big, but we knew that, and I had adequate space in my entertainment center. I actually love the look of the console. It's got a cool unique look and it's a conversation piece for sure. Now I need to get that charging dock for the dual sense and I'm set.",3,english
Rene Delgado,5,"Other then Launch Issues, this console is awesome",the United States ,20201121,True,"  **Even though I was lucky enough to snag one for myself, I do hate that how this whole high supply demand issue happened bots shouldn't be able to clear out inventory that quick. We need a new 2VA for buying so the bots get cut out.**Official Review.It's an awesome piece of tech! I had every single ps console at one time and it gets better each time. The new updated controllers are comfortable in the hand. I like the mic in controllers, no more reason your team in any shooter game have no mic.The console itself is huge! Fast load ups. Heard of some systems had defects lucky for me I didn't have one. Sound coming off the system is non existent. Most all ps4 games can be played.  I connected my PSVr to it and it works smoothly as well. Highly recommend this console.",3,english
Jacinto Rodriguez Montoya,1,Don't by,the United States ,20201211,False,  Not cool,29,english
Johnebs,4,Well rounded console. But dont pay more than the MSRP.,the United States ,20201230,True,"  Great console in terms of power. Games look and run great. I like the design a lot but in my opinion it's too big.So far I've had no problem with the console but I really hate the shiny plastic. Mine has a very visible scratch already and I've only clean it once with a microfiber cloth.Is it worth the price? For a PlayStation fan or someone that wants to play the latest and greatest, absolutely. If you simply want a console to play modern games here and there, then get the cheaper Xbox Series S.Is it worth the scalpers price? Absolutely NOT. Do yourself a favor and wait.",3,english
William,5,Good stuff,the United States ,20201116,True,"  I gotta say, I wouldn't have got to order a PS5 on release day if it weren't for the snappy notification I got and 1 tap buying of Amazon being so swift. Walmart couldn't handle the traffic, but Amazon took it like a champ... But I digress, I'm here to talk about the PS5.The set up of the stand they give you is a little awkward to figure out, but it was an easy install. Other than that, it's as simple to set up as a PS4 was. Plug in the power and the HDMI cords, start up. It took me about 3 hours to update/transfer my system stuff. My one complaint on the PS5 homescreen stuff is that there currently isn't backgrounds/themes to select through, but whatever game/app/media you're highlighting will mostly be the background... So it's currently not a huge gripe. I'm sure there will be options in a future update.Now, how does it feel and play? For the most part... Good. I recommend the system's playhouse game to get you familiar with the many possible perks of the controller(s). As one big plus is that each controller has a mic right in them. At the moment I only have Bugsnax installed as a PS5 game, so I can't much comment on how their exclusive games are. (Bugsnax ia super childish, so it's not my cup of tea.) But I can confirm there are still are loading screens for PS4 games, but it feels MUCH less laggy with a PS5. I can't guarantee that you won't ever disconnect with it, but it seems to play online smoothly... Except games like EA's Starwars Battlefront 2, that game's still a laggy mess for me.It comes with about 800g memory free space when booted up, but I plugged in my 2T storage data I had for the PS4 and it didn't struggle to recognize what's on it after the data tranfer process. There's also 2 USB ports in thw back, which tells me if I run low on data for my 2T storage I have a second port for double the data right away... I'll look into that later.The only bug I've heard about the system is if you leave it in rest mode it may freeze or something, but Sony is aware of the issue and os already working on fixing it in a future update. So even with the tiny issues I discussed that's probably going to be resolved in future updates, I'm giving the PS5 a 5 star rating. I don't regret owning one. Good work, Sony! And good work Amazon! The delivery went smoothly as well.",3,english
Fonzin,5,You’ll get all the single moms for sure!,the United States ,20201213,True,"  What can I say it’s a game console from the gods. It’s a game console worthy of Chuck Norris using it. In fact it’s a game console that only Chuck Norris could’ve got his hands on. That was until amazon came though with the pre order!Not only has this game console made me the most popular person in my neighborhood, literally ladies have been throwing their bra and panties at me ever since I’ve purchased this. I am now on the road to have about nine baby mamas (from all the neighborhood kids throwing their moms at me so they can play Spider-Man on my PS5)  and will soon have to sell the PS5 to pay for all their child support.So good luck getting it since I know they are sold Out! However be weary of the consequences of having such a great power in your hands.Just as Spiderman said in the game I’m playing on this PS5: with great power comes great responsibility.So be sure to wrap it up when tapping all the single moms that are throwing themselves at you so you can let their kids use your console !",3,english
Jess,4,Highly Impressive,the United States ,20201202,True,"  This is my first time getting a Playstation near the release date. I didn't know what to expect, but after a few weeks, I really am impressed.For one, games barely take any time to load. The remote it comes with has a microphone built-in, which is really cool to me. The audio that comes from it is also clear and again, simply cool. It also lets you play most PS4 games, and if you have PS Plus, they give you a free PS4 collection. It includes games like Detroit: Become Human, Uncharted 4, Ratchet and Clank, and God of War. It's a sweet deal.My only complaint is Share Play. With the PS5 having limited availability, my friend still has the PS4. We often play together through Share Play, as certain games of ours don't have online multiplayer. One example would be LEGO: Harry Potter. Unfortunately, a PS5 and PS4 cannot Share Play with each other. I figured PS5 games couldn't be shared, but PS4 games can't either. Neither system is capable of sharing with the other. I really hope this is fixed in the future, as it blocks me from playing a lot of games with my friend.",2,english
Joshua Szpakowski,5,Big Upgrade from Previous Generation,the United States ,20201125,True,"  I got this system when Amazon sneakily put it up during a Walmart scheduled stock. I must say that this system is a tremendous upgrade from the previous generation of consoles. The controller with its updated rumble and the addition of adaptive triggers is fantastic to use! There is no real way to describe the triggers on it. The gameplay from COD and Miles Morales I have played looks and feels great. I have yet to find any downside during gaming. This is a monster in terms of size, so make sure you have a place to put it if you do find one!",3,english
Ridge  Tawdrous,3,Love the console but bad service,the United States ,20201114,True,"  Off the bat, the box is HUGE and heavy, not a great thing for a console, might as well get a PC. Secondly, I had a HORRIBLE experience with Amazon. Delayed shipping twice and the customer service manager did not even know why or when my shipment will be shipped or why it was delayed. Otherwise, I love the PS5 and it’s super high graphics is a really nice upgrade from the PS4 and the controller is sheesh amazing!!",6,english
Fro,4,"A Premium Console Experience that is Powerful, but that is just beginning to scratch its Potential",the United States ,20201112,True,"  [Initial Thoughts—Please stay tuned as I plan to add to this as I go]Opening the Box:Unboxing the PS5 reminded me of my first experience with Apple products years and years ago.  And if you are not an Apple fan, you might not realize, how, back in the dark ages, tech was haphazardly packaged or that everyone else largely does it the “Apple way” nowadays.  Needless to say, my experience was refined, not clunky, with the layout making sense, and very little wasted space.The Beast inside:The PS5 itself, is, well, massive.  It dwarfs the PS4 Pro, and hell, even the new options from Microsoft.  The styling of this hunk of plastic and metal is equally in your face.  There is no two ways about it, some will love it, others will hate it and pray for a refined “slim version” to come sooner than later.  I am more the former than the latter as I enjoy something a bit futuristic when it comes to my console experience.  In other words, I like that it looks like a vase, even if it has become the ridicule of many who make many phallic jokes about it.  That said, the disc drive version, which I have is a bit awkward at the base as it is a bit more “girthy” (Yeah, I know, I know.) than the digital edition.Setup:Setup experience is, well, exceptional.  Ladies and gentlemen, I have been gaming a long a** time.  My first console was an Atari 2600 and man, oh man, have we come a long way from that thing.  It is, and I will borrow the old catch phrase from Apple-land, “it just works”.  Transferring of games and save information over your router in between your two consoles is rather seamless but depending on how much you are shipping from your PS4 to your PS5, it might take a bit.  I had heard that there was a way to directly connect the two, however, I did not do so.*That said, COD: MW (2019) gave me a bit of trouble because of the sheer size, which led me to popping in the install disc to help speed it along.Noise level of the PS5:The PS5 is rather quiet, the loudest part, and it really is not that loud, per se, is the disc drive.  And, if you owned a PS4 or PS4 Pro, you would appreciate the fact that the 4k blu ray drive in this does not sound like you are opening and closing a 55’ Chevy Truck door.  It loads quietly, largely runs quietly, and ejects, quietly.  But what about the fan?  You can hear the fan's ""whirring"" sound if you get up close to it.  Apparently, Sony has the ability to send out firmware updates that can change how the sound works.  For you tin foil hat wearing folks, be ware, BIG BROTHER is watching you....and your PS5 fan.The UI:The UI, as much as the DualSense, is pretty much the talk of the town, right?  But, it is a bit disorienting until you start to learn it.  That said, as for speed and ease of navigation, I give the overall feel of it, a solid 8/10.  Why not a perfect score, well, because nothing is perfect and I feel as if it almost a mix of the Switch’s UI and the PS4 and while I think it looks great, runs great, but I am not sure I fully love it, yet.  For instance, some functions, feel buried, but they are not really, it is just how you access them that has changed, which means, you and I have to change.  Do note, I am not saying this is for the better, I am saying this is how it is.Storage:The Elephant in the room.  Storage.  Storage is limited.  There is really no other way to say it.  For instance, after installing Fall Guys, COD: Modern Warfare (2019) and keeping Astro's Playroom installed, I had roughly 300gbs of space left.  Now, not everyone happens to like having a catalog of games on their drive, which is fine.  But many do.  And with Sony releasing a digital edition, one would think that they would, custom drive not withstanding, given a bit more.  Further, Sony does not have or has not yet released a list of drives that can populate the extra M.2 port that can take advantage of PS5s incredibly speedy architecture.  This problem is further compounded because currently, you cannot offload games onto a USB attached storage drive.  For this reason, I have adjusted my score to four stars.  4/5The Controller:The DualSense, without any game play, feels nice and hefty.  Though, I will note the D-Pad feels a bit “squishy” to me.  When playing games with it, it feels good.  I have average hands, maybe a tad small (HEY!  They are mighty hands, you leave me be!) and I did not experience any discomfort.  In games where the DualSense is programed for, you will feel things differently as you play.  It really is a step forward in that regards.  In games, however, that are not setup for it, you essentially get the feel of rumble, all day, everyday.  However, I encourage you to play Astro's playroom or Spiderman MM to get a good feel of its potential.The Games:At launch, Sony has a slight advantage with games--but not with subscription service.  Whether they are all new, Demon's Souls, for instance, is another issue.  As for playing games, I tried a couple of ""older"" titles, ""Fall Guys""  and ""COD: Modern Warfare (2019)""--most notalby, Warzone.  Both displayed improved load times, especially for the latter title.  MW had a graphical and textural pack applied to it and while it helped some, I did not feel it made that much of a difference on the newer system as compared to when I played it on my old PS4 Pro.  Indeed, it looked a bit more washed out, but consider, I had switched over from ""Fall Guys"", which is a cornucopia of colors that vary the spectrum or simply, it is like playing a game inside a bag of Skittles.  You get my point.But where this thing shines, frankly, and everyone has told you this-- and they ain't lyin' brosephus and sistersephus-- is with games built for it.  On the PS5 the best examples of this are going to be ""Demon's Souls"" and ""Spiderman: Miles Morales"" and ""Astro's Playroom"".  As of this writing, I have only really had time to play one of the three: ""Demon's Souls""--for a full review of this game and my thoughts about it, click on my name and follow the link to the review.  What can I say about the hauntingly beautiful remake of a cult classic that I hadn't said in my review?  How about this:  As good as the game is, as true as it is to the original, it should be seen as a beginning tutorial in the awesome potential of this generation of gaming, in particular, on the Playstation 5.Spiderman: MM thoughts--Depending on the version you get (launch vs ultimate), you can, for about 20 bucks more (ultimate), secure a copy of Spiderman:Remastered, which includes all the DLC of the original and has been improved to take advantage of the PS5 Ray Tracing abilities.  For those of you that played the previous versions, whether launch or GOY edition, you should find this to be a worthy ""ultimate edition"" of the game.  I enjoyed swinging around NY--especially since I had not finished all the DLC--and felt it was worth the investment to pick up this refined version of the game.  Did I mention that it loaded ridiculously fast?  You also have a choice to play this in fidelity (pretties turned on and locked at 30fps) or performance (60FPS) mode.  For me, I wanted to enjoy the glorious beauty of the game, so I stayed in fidelity mode.MM--Main game thoughts (coming soon)",2,english
dartamu02,3,"After the wait, I hope it works",the United States ,20201113,True,  Waited two months for this? Can't replace it because it is out of stock. I hope it works.

Drew,5,Finally got one!!!,the United States ,20201212,True,"  This was not easy to secure, pure luck on 11th 3am drop. Def worth the trouble tho this baby plays real nice with my lg cx. I love how much faster it is although i guess you’d get that from up-to-date specs lol. Actually plays cyberpunk now and soon even better with free nextgen update in 2021! The UI will take some getting used as it’s different then last gen but everything is really good in regards to graphics and new dualsense  controller. Next gens here!",4,english
cyko79,4,It's a playstation,the United States ,20201221,True,"  It's taking some time for compatible software and hardware to become available, so this is from playing Assassin's Creed Valhalla and some PS4 games on it. First major compliant is that it keeps shutting off when I put it in rest mode. This causes the console to search for errors and then lecture you about turning it off properly. It also prevents itself from letting the controller turn it back on when this happens, you have get up off the couch, walk all the way over there, then push the button on console itself. It's getting really annoying. Hope there's an update to fix that soon. Load times are WAY down, I don't even have time to check facebook on my phone during load screens any more. The controller doesn't feel as large as it looks, which is nice. Takes a while to charge, but can be played while charging if your cord is long enough. And finally, it's big. Like, you'll probably need to declutter your TV area and get rid of stuff that don't spark joy, big. But it works well, glad I got it.",1,english
E. Seekford,4,The Playstation 5 is a very good console with a few problems...,the United States ,20201118,True,"  Overall I am happy with my purchase of the Playstation 5, but there are some problems with the console. The console is fast and responsive and most things work fine. However, the new UI is not nearly as good as the PS4 and many things need to be updated soon. It is more difficult to navigate the menus and find exactly what you want. I hate not having a long press on the PS5 logo on the controller like the PS4 had before. I do not like that they have trophies further hidden in the system which makes it harder to get to them. The SSD is super fast, but there is nowhere near enough storage and there is currently no way to expand that storage. The built in Astro's Playroom game is very fun and is a great way to show off the system and controller. Again, I am happy with the purchase but Sony has a lot of things to fix over the next 6 months to a year to make it a better experience.",2,english
Courtney,5,"Runs amazing, got it on release day for $500",the United States ,20201127,True,"  Noticed a lot of 1 star reviews from people who didn't get the product. I got this for $500, I saw it randomly get stock for $1,600 on release day and figured it was someone trying to resell their stock, maybe by someone who got their pre-order. I got lucky and while fighting with walmarts website I happened to check Amazon and saw it on sale for $500 and got it on release day. It arrived not even 2 days later (I have prime).The product itself is wonderful, runs fast and smoothly, I'm in love with the remote, and been trying to find an excuse to play it everyday. Love that I can play ps4 games on it cause there aren't a lot of ps5 games out yet, so if you didn't get the ps5 yet, don't worry, breathe, you're not missing a ton of games so far.",3,english
Glenn,2,"can not sit on side, overheats, limited games as of 1/5/2021",the United States ,20210105,True,"  I wanted to like it, I rally did.  Personnel taste, it is ugly.  It's an example of ""style"" over functionality.  The PS5 can not be set on it's side securely and has to stand up - limiting where you can place it.  Another serious design flaw is while it is standing up the vents are on the bottom of the PS5 and the vent holes are too small for adequate cooling of the CPU/GPU (APU since it is an AMD).  I am very disappointed in the Sony PS5, I would not recommend when you have Micro$oft X Box and Nintendo switch.  At this time (1/5/2021) due to the limited games, my family is still buying switch games, and trying to find used PS4 games to play on the PS5 - Why have a PS5 then?  Yes the graphics are great - but it has horrible cooling design flaws, personally I believe it is ugly, it can not be secured to sit on its side, and the game selection is bad.  Astrobot is a cool game... OK we have one we play.",1,english
NegroISO,4,Backwards Compatibility - Launch Quarter Window,the United States ,20201117,True,"  As of November 17, 2020 the PS5 Disc edition is nice. It has some cool horsepower behind it making games that were either patched post-launch or pre-launch fun to play again.Days Gone got a 25gb patch to give us 60fps and a bit better textures.Ghosts of Tsushima got a patch to give us full 4K and 60fps.Last of Us II got a patch, hoping for Uncharted series.Over-all I would say PS5 is what PS4 should have been at 1080p.. meaning they should have shot for 1080p/60 vs 4K/30, but that's every console generation, one step behind and 3 more steps behind after that.Just waiting on more titles to get some post-launch patching so I can replay my PS4 library... At this point if you don't have a PS5 and are only wanting one  for new games, might as well wait. All the games out now are cross-generation meaning they probably aren't taking full advantage of either Xbox or PS5 hardware.",1,english
Ashlee Collins,1,DO NOT BUY MARKED UP PS5's!,the United States ,20201118,False,"  I beg you, do NOT buy these PS5's for the steep price of $1500 and up.  You are promoting the problem!  I agree with those who say that Playstation handled this poorly (because it's true!)...but if everyone continues to buy the marked up consoles, the bots win and will continue to buy up all available stock as soon as it hits the sites.  Just sit back, and wait.  Keep trying to buy consoles for the regular price.  Lets force these companies to figure out a better way to sell these products.  Make them work for your hard-earned money!",26,english
Terrence,5,The wait is over!!!,the United States ,20210127,True,"  Finally got my PS5!  Everything I imagined and more.  Going from a basic PS4 to this has been a dream.  Playing Cyberpunk and Star Wars Jedi Fallen Order with a stable 60fps is beyond awesome.  MK 11 plus the other 2 games I mentioned load so incredibly fast.My Pros:- The best controller I've ever held in my hands.  Guys/Gals with big hands will fall in love with this controller.- The battery life feels like it last forever.  Nice to have your controller running for hours without having to worry about a charge.- Menu is easy to navigate and I love the UI.  Just sucks there arent any themes yet.  Hope they get added down the line!- Was very happy and pleasantly surprised when I could hook up the stand for my SkullCandy PLYR 1 headset and they worked like a charm and still sounded great.  Made sure to turn off 3D audio because that headset doesnt have that feature.- This system is beautiful.  Some people hate it but I fell in love with the design.Cons:Really, my only complaint is that this system is huge lol and I didnt fully understand when people said this until I got mine.  Definitely a big boy.  Not really a negative for me but if I had to complain about something that's it.Extra info:Was delivered in pristine condition.  No dents or dings even on the outside box.  Also I heard that some had issues with the sleep mode.  I've had none.  Not saying it doesnt exsist but personally I have had no problems with it.  However i have heard about people with external hard drives that have an issue with putting your PS5 in sleep mode with the external hard drive attached.  Dont have any info on that but I would look up info on the subject just to be on the safe side of things.  Havent tested the haptic feedback yet, so I cant give my thought on that yet.I'm completely satisfied with this purchase and it went beyond my expectations.",1,english
tyler serrano,2,Don’t recommend buying yet,the United States ,20201203,True,  Was so happy to get my hands on one after waiting for it to release and i can’t even use it it shuts off completely when playing any game and i can’t seem to find a solution to this issue. No company has helped yet,4,english
Tim,5,Amazing System (if you can find one),the United States ,20210103,True,"  Not really much left to say about this system. It is extremely tough to find now. I got lucky with preorders back in September. The system arrived launch day in November. Here's a quick list of pros and cons:Pros:-the dual sense is the real deal. It's a huge new immersion level to gaming.-the games load rapidly on the SSD.-some games take advantage of next gen technology like ray tracing.-HDR looks amazing on this device and seamlessly works between games and UI.-Playstation store downloads are fast. Can download and install large games within an hour.-dolby digital surround sound is amazing with the right hardware.Cons:-of course the biggest is the system is impossible to find now. This is a factor of COVID supply chain issued, inability to purchase in store, and holiday rush madness.-no support for dolby atmos.-the system itself is massive. Although I personally like the design a lot.-the hard drive all things considered is too small. It will need an expansion soon.-many games now are 70 dollars.",0,english
Jerry ,3,"Great system, but missing charging cable",the United States ,20201204,True,"  I've been playing Playstation for as long as I can remember. My family's first system from Sony was the PS2, which was a lot of fun as a kid. Years later, I am still getting a lot enjoyment out of my new PS5.The system is great. Performance is better than anything I've played on yet. Worth every dollar.If you're on the edge about upgrading from your PS4 there are some things to consider:- Backwards compatibility ( you can play most PS4 games on your new PS5, disk and all). Purchasing PS4 games from the PS Store is possible. You are also still able to join parties and play games with your friends who have PS4 consoles. It's almost like having both systems in one!- More power and speed. Your games load MUCH faster. Some load times are non-existent. Graphics are amazing. You can enjoy games and shows in 4K if your tv is capable of it. Switching between games and navigating the main menu is seamless; everything takes little to no time at all.- New controller. The controller is new and improved. The adaptive triggers are a neat little addition, although I don't use them because they will put in at a disadvantage in competitive gaming; it's still fun in a single player / co-op experience though. The HD Rumble feature isn't new to me since it's also on Switch, but it definitely improves the experience.- Free game upgrades. There are some games that allow you to upgrade from PS4 to PS5 versions. If you have the disk version then you will have to keep the disk handy to continue playing the game.I haven't seen everything the PS5 can do yet since there aren't many games pushing it to it's fullest potential yet so there is more to come.One complaint that I had which isn't about the system itself, is Playstation's customer service. I ordered my system from Amazon a few days after the system launch and while unboxing it, I noticed that it didn't include a charger for the controller. I figured Sony just left the chargers out to save money (which made me upset at first), and I was going to go out to buy one until I remembered my Nintendo Switch remote came with a USB-C charger. I ended up using that one up until now.After watching an unboxing video, I saw realized my system was supposed to come with a USB-C charger, but I'm assuming it was mistakenly left out because Sony was rushing to get systems shipped out.I contacted Playstation support about it, and they told me they weren't responsible for it since it was sold through Amazon and told me to tell Amazon the issue. I then talked to Amazon, and they basically told me it was a manufacturer issue and I could buy an Amazon brand USB-C charger if needed. I was VERY disappointed at both of their responses, but more with Sony customer service because they put the product together and refused to help me. I am just lucky that I had a spare USB-C to use and I was able to play my system when I bought it.Moral of the story, the PS5 is a great system. Playstation Support not so much.(Edit: Amazon gave me $10 credit for the cord that was missing. Not exactly what I wanted, but it helps)",1,english
JustaRandomGuy,5,The Next Gen Game Console!,the United States ,20201219,True,"  This is definitely the most toughest purchase in game/console history.  I am pretty sure PS5 will get more stocks in the future. Anyway, I am so lucky that i was able to buy my PS5 at retail price.  This console is REALLY REALLY awesome.  Excellent graphic on my 4K TV and amazing performance that the console can deliver by its powerful GPU.  The PS5 itself is already a piece of art. This PS5 feels like the future of console gaming!  I love it!!  I cant wait to play Cyberpunk 2077.",3,english
Mario,5,"Ps5 Hermosa, fina y silenciosa",the United States ,20201125,True,"  Fui afortunado al lograr comprarla en la segunda tanda que habilitó Amazon, tardó unos días en llegar a Colombia, me encontraba muy ansioso ya a la vez asustado por tanta noticia de fallos en la entrada hdmi, sonido fuerte del ventilador entre y en el peor de los casos, que me llegará un ladrillo en reemplazo de la consola, esperaba que no fuera uno de los desafortunados.  Por fin la tengo en mis manos, me encontraba asustado, al destaparla me deslumbró su belleza, al conectarla me encuentro que es un producto de calidad, bien fabricado, demasiado silenciosa, veloz y fresca, llevo horas jugando y no tengo problema alguno, excelente consola, del control ni hablar, es algo fuera de este mundo, si calidad en la construcción y su vibración 3d es de lo mejor que sony ha fabricado a la fecha.Saludos desde la ciudad de Cali - Colombia",2,spanish
Nikk,5,I got mine on release date.,the United States ,20201116,True,  I am gonna start off by saying I was lucky to get a pre order on time and I got this console on the release date so I consider myself pretty lucky. As far as console goes it’s freaking huge almost the size of my pc case in height but I don’t mind at all because this console stays cool and doesn’t make that jet engine sound that PS4 made also the controller is so good this time that for the first time I will say that I prefer this controller over Xbox controller. This controller is that good but I got big hands so maybe that’s why I love it. People with small hands might have different opinion.,1,english
Jeffrey,5,Absolutely Amazing!,the United States ,20201118,True,"  I was lucky enough to be one of the people that received a PS5 on launch day. The features and design of this new console is amazing! Load times are way faster, graphics are much improved, and the details in the hardware is phenomenal. For example, if you look very closely at the controller (and portions of the console) you can see very tiny little X, O, Squares, and Triangles. It's little touches like this that makes the console feel special. On top of that, the controller is much improved from the PS4. The adaptive triggers are mind blowing as they really enhances the immersion when playing games. Very good start to the next generation of console gaming.",1,english
Brad Smith,5,"Ps5 is big, ugly, and cool af.",the United States ,20201117,True,"  *** Thanks amazon for delivering my preorder on launch day! ****I honestly only made this review because I felt bad the only reviews posted are sadfats complaining about scalpers. Patience kids, you will get one soon as supply catches up.I am primarily a PC gamer, but this console really keeps up with my new 3090 rig. Adding the SSD drive is no joke and this ps5 is really really fast.Demon souls loads in seconds and the UI is a breeze.Only tiny complaint is that my gf thinks its hideous and ugly in my media room entertainment center and I tend to agree.System is quiet and keeps cool. New controller feels less cheap and does have some fun rumble features.If you play PC this is a great product because you know SONY will have all the best first party single player games for the next few years.",2,english
Amazon Customer,5,Too much to say..... lol,the United States ,20201115,True,"  Where to begin... thats the hardest part. Sony knocked it out the part this time. From the design to the performance. The feeling you get quickly shifting through menus seamlessly makes your ps4 feel so ancient haha. Its perfect in all aspects.The UI, SSD, 3D Audio, graphics, performance, features and the controller.... so much to say about the controller. Adaptive triggers can fight back or have tension depending on what the situation is. Call of duty shows it by feeling like your pulling the trigger, and feeling recoil. Astros playroom is another story. Boxed in free with every ps5. It will make you smile like a little kid! The feeling from the haptic feedback and the sounds to go with will make for an enjoyable experience.Luckily I was able to purchase one. Seeing a link as soon it was posted that night seconds after is what got me in. Wishing everyone can get one but they are going like hot cakes!",1,english
Michelle B,5,Amazing! Esp with a 65” OLED & Sonos!,the United States ,20210101,True,"  I preordered this on September 16th with no issues what so ever. Was delivered on launch day. Even secured a second one from Target online just in case this one didn’t come through for any reason. Well Amazon came through as I mentioned so I ended up doing a special meet up at my local Target CS counter the following day (after receiving the Target console as well) and returned the second console so a random stranger I met in Target the day before (who was desperate to get one but couldn’t seem to score one no matter how hard he tried) could buy my extra one for retail... I felt I did a good deed that day and was extremely happy to see the joy on his face instead of me taking advantage and reselling the second console — even though I’m disabled and my husband has lost both of his jobs this year — one of almost 25 years and one of over 14... We definitely needed the extra money but you know what? The good karma has to be worth more...! Happy New Year all and I wish everyone the best of luck in securing a PS5 if you haven’t been able to as of yet, it’s an absolutely amazing system, especially when paired with a 65” OLED and Sonos Surround/Dolby Atmos system! Game on!",1,english
garret wood,5,Quite the upgrade.,the United States ,20201113,True,"  Fantastic system, a beautiful chunky boy that is every bit worth the $399-499 it costs. Highly recommend playing Astro's Playroom to get a feel for the controller. The haptic feedback isn't just a gimmick, it's honestly fantastic, and if the developers of games take it seriously it can dramatically change the way games are played. Miles Morales is a treat, and is the game I'd recommend most for players to really see the beauty of the system at its finest. Whether you prefer the gorgeous visuals of full 4k fidelity with ray tracing, making New York City shine like never before, or the silky smooth 4k60 of performance mode which feels so good, you'll be thrilled with either choice. Absolutely worth it, don't regret at all.",1,english
Steel,5,"Amazing console, quality controller",the United States ,20210118,True,"  I am surprised at how amazing this console is. It is fairly quiet (every once in a while it will spin the disc or crank up the fans, but only for a little bit). It is a massive console, however.The magic comes mostly from the controller it comes with. It is very ergonomic and has a high quality feel. The adaptive triggers (when implemented in games) is engaging and doesn't feel too gimmicky. The touchpad is very convenient as well.My favorite console to date!",1,english
mustafa quraishi,4,"Good Console, Bad Launch",the United States ,20201113,True,"  The next-gen outperforms 99.99% of same-priced PCs but that's too be expected. It seems like a solid benchmark for the next few years but it will be interesting to see how it holds up towards the end of its lifespan. I also wish they would add in support for Discord or some way to talk to players on PC. I know they updated the app so you can talk from your phone but even that isn't good.Although I was lucky enough to get one, I feel the launch was handled horribly as I found much of the stock in the hands of single persons.",2,english
Goodrats,5,So far...So amazing!,the United States ,20201119,True,"  I'm gonna keep this short for anyone thinking of picking up a ps5. I have a pc that i've spent over 2000 dollars building, it runs everything i throw at it on high settings. For 500 dollars the PS5 does some things faster and smoother then my expensive PC. You can not beat the performance and tech. that you get from the PS5 for the cost of 500 dollars. Not to mention the fact that the controller might be the most badass and most comfortable that I have ever used. If you do get a PS5 don't pass up hopping into the free game Astro's Playroom that comes with your console to see the potential the controller really has.",1,english
Customer,4,Awesome if you can get one,the United States ,20201129,True,"  Preordered and received right on launch day!System OS is still pretty glitchy, I have had a few crashes while playing Miles Morales. There's also a strange ""coil"" sounds in some blu ray units including mine. I play with a soundbar so I don't really hear it that much when playing, but I hear it more early on when the console starts reading the disc but the game hasn't started yet so there's no sound from the game.Otherwise the OS is very snappy and smooth. I like the look of the console, despite it being massive.It's very easy to transfer PS4 games and saves to PS5. Download speeds are 10x improved compared to PS4 as well.Controller is the biggest noticeable improvement, haptic triggers feel great and controller is just very comfortable.Overall a great console despite some early glitches.",1,english
Bruno,5,Great console!,the United States ,20201202,True,"  Great console if you can get your hands on one. Please don't buy from scalpers. I was lucky enough to score a pre-order from Amazon but if I hadn't I would wait until next year when stock levels normalize and would not pay any more than MSRP.I upgraded from the original PS4 and there is a very noticeable difference in image quality and load times. The UI takes some getting used to compared to PS4. The controller is great, bigger and heavier than Dualshock 4. The haptics are cool but not mind blowing. I'm curious to see how they can be used by game devs.The console is fairly large and imposing, which can be good and bad depending on who you ask. The aesthetic is definitely growing on me though.I think either Xbox and PS5 are great new gen consoles but I enjoy PS exclusives more.",0,english
Darryl D,5,Everything I was hoping for in this next gen console!,the United States ,20201121,True,"  Everything I was hoping for in this next gen console! Out of the box, the PS5 looks clean and has a futuristic aesthetic. I do kind of wish the console was black with the blue glow. The graphics are on point and the load times are super fast. Super smooth so far and have loved every second playing it so far!",2,english
Isaiah Medellin,5,Great Next Generation system!,the United States ,20201116,True,"  Great well functioning system and have spent over six hours so far playing with the console and overall performance is top notch and quality. So far I've had barely any complaints and cons from it. The controller is amazing and creative with it's functions. I would highly recommend the Astro's Playroom (free game for PS5 owners) to get the functions of the controller.My dislikes for the console is that it is very big and bulky. As a person with not much room for it, had to make some arrangements for the tall or wide (depending on the preference and location) in your home.Aside from it's massive size, the console is an amazing piece of technology and cannot wait to see how far this generation from PlayStation goes.",2,english
Amazon Customer,5,I’m a scalper!,the United States ,20201226,True,"  Bought 4 of these and was able to flip 3 of them for 1300 and kept the last one for myself! Console is great, Sony outdid themselves and made me a ton of money at the same time! In december 24th i sold my last disc edition to a single mother who spent her last 1.2k with me in order to buy her son the console. It made me feel so good that I was able to make her son’s christmas. Felt like Santa Claus.",3,english
Matthew Rhoads,5,Phenomenal Console,the United States ,20201115,True,"  The Playstation 5 is a blazing fast console with the potential to change the way we as humans game forever. When I first opened the shipping box I was amazed at how massive the Playstation 5 really is. It measures out at almost 16 inches vertically and definitely resembles more of a gaming PC than a console. The set-up of the console itself was relatively easy with both the card UI and using the Playstation App to link my account, the entire process took relatively moments to complete. Once booted up and updated I began to insert my PS5 games, Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Spider-Man Miles Morales. Both games took less than 30 minutes to copy over to the Solid State Drive and started up without any hitches. I began with Spider-Man Miles Morales and was instantly amazed by the graphical capabilities of the PS5, native 4K is already an awe-inspiring experience but it became even more sublime when zipping around New York City on my PS5 looked more like watching a movie than playing a video game. However, not only are the graphical capabilities of the PS5 absolutely astounding but Sony's construction of the Dualsense controller is markedly genius. While playing Spider-Man I could noticeably feel each and every web leaving my hands and the resistance building in the triggers as I soared across the city. Overall, the PS5 is a game-changer, making 4K gaming an absolute blast while maintaining maximum potential for the future of gaming.",1,english
Zack Campbell,5,"The best console I have ever bought, and the only new one that really feels NEXT GEN",the United States ,20201115,True,"  The only next-gen console that feels NEXT GEN.- Wildly smooth operating system- Haptic feedback you have to feel to understand- Similarly incredible adaptive triggers- Tempest 3D audio that changes the way I play games- A new and beautiful user interface, the way any new platform should launch- The best selection of launch titles I've seen- A gorgeous and unique designHonestly, I almost always buy consoles and major gaming hardware at launch. I have never been as pleased as I am with PS5.My Xbox Series X feels like a mistake. :/",1,english
Michael J Egan,5,Love the 4k start up screen,the United States ,20201218,True,  Works great so far the system is 100% upgrade from the PS4 Pro in every way the controller is a 300% upgrade from the cheap piece of junk controller that came with my PS4 Pro and regular PS4 as for games you have Spiderman as a triple A title and then a lot of average games Demon Souls is a beautiful looking remaster of the old PS3 Demon Souls game but its just that THE SAME GAME with better graphics and with a $70 pricetag a complete ripoff!,1,english
Konner McIntosh,5,The future of gaming!!,the United States ,20201114,True,"  With that INSANE DualSense controller and the crazy high resolution, it truly is the future of gaming! I LOVE THIS SYSTEM! I’ve had it for about 8 hours now and I’ve played it for every second. The hype and amount of trouble I went through to get it was all worth it! The controller alone could be a selling point, it is so crazy to have the back triggers properly recreate what you are doing in game! Plus, getting my PlayStation 4 games working on it was a breeze! A crazy fast memory transfer by connecting them both to the internet was shocking to me, because I transferred roughly 100ish gigabytes worth of memory in NINETEEN MINUTES. Also I love how there are finally some ports on the back of a PlayStation! It was about time to do that! Sorry if this review is all over the place but I just wanted to let you all know that this truly is an amazing buy. Good luck to everyone trying to get one!",1,english
Bruce Wang,5,"What else can I say, Its awesome if you manage to buy one !",the United States ,20210113,True,"  This is my first playstation console, and as a PCMasterRace veteran this console has been wonderful.I bought this because I no longer have the time to upgrade, and manage my PC to play all the latest games, and I also wanted to play the Sony exclusives such as God of War, Uncharted,  Spiderman,  and Last Of Us.The only thing I wish Sony did better was build more co-op games so that I can enjoy it with my significant other, for now that role is exclusive to my Switch.My only complaint has been this weird issue where it keeps starting up when I turn on my TV, and I haven't had the time to figure out how to disable it yet, and the UI is unnecessarily cluttered with too much info. These are mostly nitpicks so please don't let that dissuade you from buying this console.",1,english
PJ Jameson,5,Great next-gen system with amazing load times,the United States ,20201230,True,"  Positives: Graphics are great (ray-tracing adds so much to the game), UI nice, controller is absolutely amazing. But the best part of this is the SSD and it’s insane load times. Some games, load times are a legit blink of an eye.Downsides: storage is crap. After all the needed software, your left with around 660GB for games. Which today is only 4 games or so, give it take. Yeah you could use an external SSD/HD but then you lose the best part of this system - it’s amazing load times. Sony needs to open it up to allow internal storage upgrades. Other than that, and this next one should have no real barring on you getting one, but the actual PS5 is Huge and Ugly.",0,english
Kham L.,5,Oh yeah! Believe the hype,the United States ,20201114,True,  I'm so lucky to be able to per-order this and Amazon was great that they actually delivered it on launch day when they said it might not arrive initially.  Watching all the YouTube reviews and them showing the graphics on this thing drove the hype into overdrive.  Now getting it and trying it myself made me a believer of how great a system Sony has come up with again.  I hope everyone reading this is able to get one soon as this system is awesome!,1,english
Agteyiiccvjk,3,Not at all what it’s hyped to be.,the United States ,20201207,True,  I’ve played this and the new xbox.  Xbox wins.  This is only marginally better than the last PS.  Save you money.,3,english
WLouie,5,This system is huge!,the United States ,20201129,True,"  I put it next to my 55 inch TV and now it looks like it shrank down to the size of a computer monitor.Graphically, it's a small leap over the PS4 Pro. Gone are the 10x performance generational leaps in home consoles. We are hitting a brick wall with graphical fidelity. For those of us who remember the way we felt when we moved from PS1 to PS2.. then PS3.. this will not be like that. PS5 is just over 2x more power than PS4 Pro.My kids love the PS5, so it gets 5 stars!",1,english
DangerWillRobinson,5,Way better than Xbox!,the United States ,20201120,True,"  Had Xbox one after PS3 and I'm so happy to be back with Sony. The PS5 is amazing! It's bulky, yet sleek. It's super fast, yet quiet. The controller is a huge win for the PS5. If youre like me and didn't have a PS4, once you join playstation plus you get most of the big games that came outfl for ps4. I haven't even played a PS5 game yet because I wanted to catch up on all my faves from PS4 that I missed. If you're not sure between Xbox and PS5, choose PS5. You'll thank me later.",1,english
EDHOLLA ,5,Amazing system. I recommend it highly.,the United States ,20201128,True,"  I got mine from Amazon after worrying so much. I thought I was going to get screwed out of one. I know how hard it is to get one because of COVID. If you’re on the fence don’t worry buy a PS5. The console and graphics are the amazing considering the low price compared to a PC. The controller is now my new favorite gaming controller. I don’t know how to explain it but I was completely blown away by it. I recommend playing Astro Bot Playroom that you get as a free download. I don’t usually like those type of games but it really impressed me. The stuff that game does with the controller had me and my friend laughing in joy. The console also has a great lineup of launch titles that are far superior to what the PS4 and Xbox one had. Also, it’s considerably better than what the Xbox Series X & S offer at launch. I don’t think it’s even comparable to be honest. The console has backwards compatibility with all PS4 games which is awesome(minus a couple obscure titles). I really am seriously impressed by the PS5 and it far exceeded my expectations. I recommend buying one if you can find one. The service from Amazon was also great thankfully.",1,english
Thang Nguyen,5,Got me back into console gaming!,the United States ,20201202,True,"  I usually own the current generation PlayStation and a gaming PC. For the past few years, I have rarely touched my PlayStation due to long load times, inferior graphics (compared to PC), and nothing new. The PlayStation 5 has changed that completely. From the controller, to the new tech (controller, processing power, picture by picture game sharing), I absolutely love this console. While it doesn't compare to my PC in terms of specifications (AMD Ryzen 9 5900X, ASUS RTX 3090 OC), I would still highly recommend it because of the PlayStation exclusives, ease of use, backwards compatibility, and finally how quiet it runs when compared to the PS4 / PS4 PRO.",0,english
David e,5,Best console,the United States ,20201210,True,"  Kinda crazy to see all these 1 star “reviews” of people upset they couldn’t get one. Since I ACTUALLY purchased one I’ll leave a review. Zero issues, controller is great, build quality is excellent, fast... I mean I can’t find anything to complain about but I have one",2,english
TechHead,5,Lightning fast and feels next gen,the United States ,20201129,True,  Incredible load times and boot times. Mostly playing ps4 games on here and it's a significant upgrade. Load times are incredible and games have no lag or memory issues. Lightning is improved and games that offer faster frame rates and hdr look much better than ps4. Only played 2 ps5 games and they are impressive though it is still early days as most games are really just upgraded ps4 games. I got this more as a hardware upgrade as there aren't must play ps5 games yet though that is just around the corner a year from now. And the price is steep for a $500 console but considering how much better it is than a dedicated gaming pc at $1200 it is a bargain.,0,english
Alexis Bruno,5,Great Console,the United States ,20210118,True,"  I love everything about the next generation of consoles. The PS5 is the beat console I’ve owned. I’ve always been a PlayStation guy and my love for the company grows even more with this one. The load times are almost nothing now and the controller. The controller is the best part about it, the adaptive triggers and haptic feedback just give it that next gen feel. Amazon was very careful with my delivery and it arrived earlier than expected and no damage on the box.",2,english
Jesse,5,Amazing game console!,the United States ,20210112,True,"  I have not owned a console for about 7 years after switching to PC primarily for gaming, with the shortage on GPUs I decided to try and get my hands on a PS5 instead for this generation of games to be released and I'm glad I did! My favorite thing about the system is the controller and the way it gives feedback, it simply feels amazing! Only downside is the new video game prices being at $70 and not many deals unlike PC where I find deals on different apps or sites every other weekend. Overall to me this console is worth it for the exclusives yet to come and since I never owned a PS4 I'm enjoying all the sales on PS4 games on the cheap! I am saddened however that several friends can not find any in stock... hope this year is more promising with inventory so everyone can enjoy the console!",1,english
Alexander,5,Blows all other consoles out of the water!,the United States ,20210113,True,"  Obviously, I'm not writing a review griping about the process of getting one. I am one of the fortunate ones that got one.With the pandemic, I've found that PS5 has been the perfect solution for all the other things that I can't do. The graphics are so much more advanced than PS4, it's not even funny. Plus it's a lot easier to use as a media hub than PS4 was since they split up games/media in the home screen.PS5 has been my best friend ever since I got it and I'm really happy I was able to grab one!",1,english
Aldin Rizvanovic,5,Very appealing but lacks some Key features that the Xbox series x capitalizes on.,the United States ,20210116,True,"  Love the layout design, sleek feel too it. Also the adaptive triggers are pretty cool new feature. Runs smooth and quiet. I have both The Xbox Series X and PS5 and currently the Xbox Series X seems better. Especially playing Warzone, does not have a input lag ( responds time to your console from pressing a button on your controller). This is very much needed to have the slightest advantage when in a shoot out. It’s like who ever pulls the trigger first wins and you can notice the Ps5 doesn’t pick it up as fast as the Xbox. That’s because the Xbox runs warzone at 120fps and  The Ps5 at 60fps on warzone. The Ps5 was not able to update it like the Xbox because it has issues upgrading last gen games because of their limited backward compatibility options. Which sucks. Cuz all I really play at the moment is warzone. Hopefully they fix it in the near future.",1,english

Sami ,5,Next Gen of gaming!,the United States ,20201118,True,  Love the console it’s a perfect purchase for those who are looking for an upgrade. Currently it is difficult to get a preorder or purchase online but eventually the supplies will meet the demand. Stay positive folks. A lot of my friends are looking forward to purchase it also. The interface is simple to use and I transferred all my PS4 data by using an Ethernet port tool my like 10 minutes. I also use a extended hard drive too for the console in expanding storage.,2,english
Sarah,5,"Purchased on release day, dumb luck",the United States ,20201115,True,"  Way very pleased that I happened to refresh the page at one of the exact right times during the 20 second long drops on release day. This console is definitely going to bring a lot of gaming fun into our household! I love the controllers vibration differences and all the little things make it so good. Now, if they'll only talk about that GTA-VI release date...I want to see player induced drive-by shooting in as HD as possible!",1,english
Ike,5,Breath taking,the United States ,20201115,True,  I received my ps5 on the 14th and was super excited to get started with it. After my unboxing and setting up the stand it was time to get my ps5 journey started. I did all the initial set up and went to the last screen where it asked me do I want to transfer all my ps4 stuff over. I click yes. This was a big mistake on my hand as I didn’t realize it was going to take that long. It was literally like 10 minutes before it said 1% I was being a little patient as I wanted to see what would happen. After about an hour it was 31% and I was getting restless. After some thorough research (Reddit) I found out there is an way easier way to get my ps4 stuff without that long wait using the cloud. So to cancel that transfer I had to shut down my ps4 and enter safety mode? I think it was called and rebuild database. Ps5 automatically restarts and you should be good to go. After that there was no more worries everything worked perfectly and I’m now enjoying the next gen console. Hopefully you all will get to enjoy soon.,1,english
Alex J. Cruz,5,Absolutely in love,the United States ,20201114,True,"  I love this console, when I got it I was blown away on how fitting the controller was in my hand. The adaptive triggers and haptic feedback bring emersion to console gaming. I love the speed of the loading and downloads. My one downside so far is downloading one game at a time. But other than that, the frame rate up to 120 hz is absolutely amazing. I couldn’t wait to get my hands on the PSV. The frame rate is so smooth now and I never knew how smooth more frames could have. I can’t wait for my friends to get this console! I dislike people review bombing because they couldn’t get their hands on a preorder",1,english
j. user,5,Fun.,the United States ,20201120,True,"  I got a ps5, and was really lucky to do so. All I have for the console are praises. It works (almost) perfectly, is really quiet, and looks pretty good too. All the negative reviews I have seen are because they cannot get one. I understand that it is difficult to buy a ps5 right now, but that isn't a reason to leave a negative review. Good luck to anyone who is trying, and I would recommend using the nowinstock forum for ps5!!",1,english
Dion,5,Great buy!! Ps5 for the win!!!,the United States ,20201205,True,  All the one star reviews are butthurt people who couldn't get a console. The system is great. It feels next gen and I'm sure it will only set itself more apart from previous gen as time goes on and new features are added or tweaked. It's loads fast and is visually appealing although it is very large. The only complaint is the internal storage is small. I live in an area where internet has a data cap (these companies are getting out of control) and so being able to delete and redownload games all the time is not ideal because one game is typically 50-100 gb and the internet is capped at 1.2 tb,0,english
SlicK RicH,5,Welcome to the Future,the United States ,20201117,True,"  Sleek, bold, and daring...Sony has ushered in the beginning of a new console generation with not only an absolutely beautiful console, but an incredibly powerful one as well. An impressively lightning fast SSD, excellent 4K and HDR support, as well as HDMI 2.1 and 120hz capability, ensure that this new powerhouse of a gaming system will be futureproof for quite some years. This new generational era will churn out fantastic games that will shock and impress all of us in the foreseeable future, as well as push the limits and potential of gaming to ambitious new heights.",1,english
Jordan W.,5,Works Great! Definitely Worth The Money At Retail,the United States ,20210111,True,"  I ended up getting this console at retail on a restock. The console worked exactly as expected and the games I were able to play, Assassin's Creed Valhalla worked amazing. The graphics were very detailed and it ran at a solid 30 fps which is good for console gaming. Overall, if you can manage to get this close to retail, or slightly above, I'd recommend it at I feel like it is a good console.",1,english
Brandi,5,Amazon delivering more smiles with PS5!,the United States ,20201114,True,"  I signed up for in stock notices of the ps5 when pre-sales first came out and didn’t think there would be a chance in getting one from Amazon because of limited stock. Two days ago, I got a pop up notice saying there was stock, immediately clicked it, added to my cart and checked out. Then I second guessed and wondered if I’d been swindled but two days later, it showed up!! My son is beyond excited! So glad there’s Amazon because WalMart has been a joke with their timeouts and website crashes.",1,english
Theo M.,5,Perfect console for next gen gaming.,the United States ,20210121,True,"  Had this console for a little over 2 weeks and it’s a great console. Comparing to the PS4 Pro it’s miles faster, cooler and quieter. Sony didn’t cut corners with this console in any way and it runs perfectly fine. Although this console has good things it also has some negative things. In order to use this console to its max you need a 4k, HDR10, and 120Hz tv/monitor. It is useless when if you are considering to play anything less than that. Currently I’m on HDR, 4K, but 60Hz and In games like Cold War (PS5 Version), the frames tend to drop when the game is at its stressful moments. RTX and other graphical improvements aren’t groundbreaking because it’s a cod game but it’s definitely noticeable on other games like Spider-Man: Miles Morales. I was running it at 60FPS in its highest setting and never seemed to go below 55. Lastly if you are moving from a base PS4 or Base Xbox it’s a night and day difference going from 720p-1080p all the way to 4K 120Hz gameplay. If you had a Xbox One X or a PS4 pro you won’t see many differences in terms of graphical advances but that isn’t a bad thing. I haven’t ran into any issues yet with this console so i can’t speak how good it is long term. Finally the console is huge. Way bigger than the base Xbox One and I can barely fit it at the spot I have it in. Not sure why Sony thought to make such a bug machine since the Series X is more powerful yet smaller. It is beautiful though not going to lie. Great Console!",0,english

Nicholas,5,A true next gen console,the United States ,20201121,True,"  I got it on launch day, delivery was fast. The console is very appealing to look at, the controller feels new and fresh compared to the PS4 controller, the haptic feedback is absolutely amazing, and the choice of launch games is also really good. If you are looking for a next gen console then I would choose this over the Xbox Series X which is more of the same. I would suggest getting a TV or monitor that is 120hz or more to get the full performance out of it. I am using a 1080 144hz monitor with HDMI 1.4 and it works great so you don't need an HDMI 2.1 capable display to use the PS5. If you want 4k 120hz then you need HDMI 2.1. It does not support 1440p monitors at the moment.",1,english
Joshua&Kayla,5,Worth it!,the United States ,20201113,True,"  The PS5 is finally here and it’s ... totally worth it. I recieved the disc version.I’ll start off by saying while there’s plenty of space you’ll want to invest in or use a external HD to hold your previous library.You can transfer between systems save date ,games, etc via a lan cable. It’s painfully easy.Using the new PlayStation app to sign in is a cinch.I’ll update more as time goes on but the system is flawless.",2,english
Eric Bailey,5,Next Generation Gaming Today!,the United States ,20210107,True,"  This sucker is worth every penny! The form factor and design is beautiful in person...even though I wasn’t originally fond of it upon the initial release. The controller and its haptics are so awesome! It really pulls you more into the game. I’m astonished at the increased amount of features they put into the new controller. It feels great in the hand too. The graphics are stunning, gameplay is super smooth, and loading is minimal. The new interface and home screen are also big improvements! This is the first gaming console that has made me feel like a kid again!",0,english
Chad L.,3,This thing is a monster but amazing!,the United States ,20201113,True,  Its so big omg ha don't like they going Xbox style at all but still an amazing machine! Also don't like you have to put it sideways go get circulation to not over heat and miss out on all the cool changing colors etc. Also hard to put the disks in. Also does not play 3d movies and won't even let you stream 3d either huge downfall for me there for that price come on now!,4,english
MP,1,Worst launch ever!,the United States ,20201115,False,"  This is one of the worst launch ever I have experienced by the company that is almost synonymous to its gaming console. Its one of the most liked brand for its consoles, not this time around. They didn’t care about their genuine customers, who wanted to get hands on JUST ONE PS5 console for the holiday season.",25,english

Hanna,5,Great Console,the United States ,20201114,True,  Super lucky to have gotten to purchase this! Games look great and are super smooth. Loading screen times are way faster then the PS4 and the menu to the console is beautiful. If there were different colors to the PS5 that would make the console a 6/5 stars.,2,english
Michael Percy,5,A true next level of Gaming,the United States ,20201113,True,  I was fortunate to be one of the first to get a PS5 and I must say it is a worth while purchase.Key highlights:Loading time is super fastRay tracing is pretty as anythingThe controller is next level with the feedback and triggers I am excited for down the road releases like FF16 and Horizon 2. I would though say wait till the SSD add on update comes for extra storage as that is the systems only weak point.Overall though very pleased.,2,english
MM,5,Get it!,the United States ,20201115,True,  So I bought this for my husband as a present. He really wanted it and was upset it was sold out everywhere. I ended up getting my hands on it and it’s the best present I ever bought him. I’m not a gamer but he is and says it has great graphics and the remote control is the best part because you feel every thing that happens in the game it feels like your in the game. I recommend this to all gamers!,1,english
Cuong D.,5,"I bought this for myself, or so I thought.",the United States ,20201119,True,"  My kids are all over Astro's Playground. When they go to bed, my wife takes over with Assassin's Creed Valhalla. I bought this system for me and I feel as though I'm getting the short end of the stick here. The only thing I can do is watch them play. The haptic triggers are best demoed with the Astro's Playground game with the controller reacting to certain elements of gameplay. Valhalla does a good job of showcasing the great graphics and fast processing. How does it play? I don't know, ask my family. Oh, I've been asked to order another controller now and it's not for me. Lovely.",1,english
Anthony,5,PS5 is Next-Gen,the United States ,20201113,True,"  Works perfectly! I've been playing Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Demon Souls, and Black Ops Cold War. Nice to be playing game at 60fps. The adaptive triggers on the Dualsense is amazing as it goes with the game you are playing. Example: in Call of Duty the trigger will change resistance on what weapon you are wielding. Playstation did an extraordinary job as usual.",2,english
Clint Brown,5,Love love love love love love love love love.,the United States ,20201115,True,"  To all the people whining that they didn’t get one. Sorry. Anyways this system so far is amazing. I was real worried about the controller feeling too different. But, it has impressed me beyond belief like why haven’t they thought this before kind of deal. The system it’s self is huge so expect to take up a lot of space on your entertain stand. As far the graphics and all that junk it lives up to the hype.",2,english
A.W. Morton,5,PS5 Delivers Exactly What It Promised,the United States ,20201124,True,"  Product was well packaged, swiftly delivered, and plays all my old ps4 games at lightening speed. Haven't purchased a ""next-gen"" game as of yet. I'm currently avoiding use of an external hard drive and ""rest"" mode until they patch the supposed problems with those features. This thing is NOT as big as everyone is making it out to be, it is whisper quiet, and I haven't had a single issue. Played it for about 20 total hours so far.",2,english
Raymond Rivera,5,Next Gen is Here!,the United States ,20201117,True,  I absolutely love the console. It’s sleek and very modern. It is larger than the PS4 so plan accordingly on where your going to put it.  It’s very quiet and the games look amazing. Don’t listen to other reviewers out there who are bashing the console simply because they couldn’t get one. For $500 your getting your monies worth.,2,english
Joyce,5,Next - gen,the United States ,20201117,True,"  The Ps5 is amazing. This console is truly next-gen. From the moment you open the box to the moment you play your first ps5 game. The experience is breathtaking. From fast load times, 4k resolution, response times, and enhanced ray tracing capabilities, the ps5 is powerful. Not to mention that the fan can only be slightly heard when playing games that require power.",2,english
Noah D.,5,Brilliant Next Gen Gaming,the United States ,20201118,True,"  I'm going to keep this relatively short, but I'll start by saying I'm new to the PlayStation family. I've been an Xbox user for the better part of the last decade, and a Nintendo fan for as long as I can remember, but it wasn't until late 2018 that the PS4 started to pull me in. I decided to hold out for the PS5 and I don't regret it at all.The console is slightly larger than I'd anticipated, but that's a non-issue. I know the design isn't for everyone, but I think it looks stunning. I'm a huge fan of the DualSense controller, and Astro's Playroom is a really great showcase for all of the controller features. It's fast, it's quiet, and Spiderman Miles Morales plays beautifully (RAY TRACING!). 10/10 would recommend.",1,english

H. Jack,5,Great Console,the United States ,20201118,True,"  While I do agree that the console itself may be a bit on the large size, using it has been a great pleasure. Impressed with the speed, navigating the menu was pretty easy, the controller is amazing with its new features. Haptic Feedback honestly changes the game depending on the title and support. Only concern will be storage space, it will get filled up fast as games slowly release. I can understand the SSD is new gen tech but it will need to resolved fast. Overall the console is a joy and no problems with heating up.",1,english
Brendan Bartanen,5,Next-gen truly feels next-gen,the United States ,20201116,True,"  First, props to Amazon for having a website that allowed me to snag one of these, as opposed to the mess over at Walmart. It arrived at my door in less than 36 hours. The console itself is simply great when paired with a high-quality 4k TV. The increase in visual fidelity is amazing while still running ~60 frames per second and the controller is awesome and immersive with the upgrades to the vibration. Love having the blu-ray player, as well. This is awesome value for $500.",2,english
Chris&Tasha,5,Graphics are too notch!,the United States ,20201117,True,  I could not be anymore excited to have got this console. Literally snagged one in 10 seconds.

LEEETTTTS GOOOOOO!!! :D,1,english
Delio,5,Glad I pre ordered in September.,the United States ,20201114,True,  Truly next gen. Transferring your data from the PS4 to the PS5 was simple and easy especially when you use a LAN Cable.

Al,5,REAL Next Gen,the United States ,20201118,True,"  Got the Xbox and PS5 and the PS5 is really next-gen. Seems like you are playing something brand new. Highly recommend if you can get your hands on it!(PS: Don't buy from scalpers. Don't pay over $600 for it, no matter how bad you want it. Nothing is worth over 100% upcharge on it. Be patient and you can stop these scummy scalpers from gaining a profit)",1,english
Harshdeep Kahlon,4,Amazing Controller. Questionable Backwards Compatibility.,the United States ,20201114,True,"  The controller is really innovative and game changing in supported games. The trigger can adjust resistance, the haptic feedback is awesome, and the built-in mic can be pretty useful.However, when you see developers on the Xbox Series X/S easily scaling their Xbox One games to 120 FPS and better quality graphics without much effort, you might wonder why they’re not doing the same thing for PS4 games on PS5. Sony does not let PS4 games utilize PS5 features without a native next-gen version. For example, Rocket League can be played at 120Hz even on the Series S, while the PS5 is stuck at PS4 Pro settings until a native next-gen version is released.",1,english
itsjayk,5,11/10 console of the generation!,the United States ,20201127,True,"  Despite other people not being able to pre order the console due to scalpers, I however enjoy and grateful of how lucky I was to play the PlayStation 5. Those who are still trying to get one, good luck and don’t buy one from one of the scalpers. It’s not worth it and I’m sure Sony will sell more next year but this time it will be for consumers to play. Not lowlife scalpers that try to make profit off a company because they’re lazy af",2,english
CRS,3,Playstation 5 is here,the United States ,20201202,True,"  Playstation 5 arrived, I was super excited to play it but unfortunatly it didnt have too many games to play. The console itself looks beautiful. Its an eyecatcher. Graphics are great and processing is good. I think it needs more games to play but for now its a so so for me. Not totally blown away.",1,english
Julio,5,Next-Gen Is Here,the United States ,20201116,True,"  You will undoubtedly have people rate the PS5 low solely because they could not get their hands on one and are angry. That doesn’t take away from the quality of the console itself.The UI is pretty clean, it boots up quickly, and games run smooth on it. The controller is a standard out and offers true improvements and innovations over the last generation which do help immerse you. There are a few quality of life options that are missing, but I would say that is more on the software side rather than the hardware side. The only problem I have with the hardware is that it is huge, making it difficult to find a nice spot for it in your living room set up. Overall, it is a jump ahead of the last generation and worth the money.",1,english
Shane M,5,Ps5>Anything else,the United States ,20201122,True,"  There is nothing not to like a out this. Impossible to find but I found one and it’s a HUGE improvement over my launch day PS4 that sounded like it was going to explode any second. It took over 2 minutes sometimes to enter or invite people to a party chat or do simple menu things.I can enter or invite into a party chat in under 3 seconds as what you click on works right away.Can’t wait to see where this goes and what they do with 4K gaming, 120+ frames and the haptic feedback on controller!",1,english
Jennifer s,5,Worth the wait,the United States ,20201202,True,  Lives up to the hype!! In my opinion the PS5 is the biggest upgrade Sony has made since the original PlayStation to PS2. Graphics and frame right are drastically improved but that will largely depend on your TV set. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers are groundbreaking! The controller feels like an expensive piece of tech. Astros Playroom is really well thought out and highlights the features of the controller. It’s not just a “toss in” game. The triggers feel like real gun triggers in COD Cold War. Unfortunately the controller batteries don’t last long. I plan on getting an extra controller eventually to solve that problem. Has been a few glitches as expected for a new console. Nothing major. Hopefully Sony will be releasing more units ASAP and they get into actual gamers hands and not bots. Amazon was the only smooth transaction I had during the release. More retailers need to take action against bots. Wish more of my friends had PS5s to play against. Hopefully soon!,0,english
Anony Mous,5,The Console Gaming Enthusiasts Love,the United States ,20201114,True,"  I was lucky enough to get this when it went on sale release day.

E-Man,5,Ninth Generation Gaming is HERE!,the United States ,20201115,True,"  This review is written from the perspective of a primarily PC gamer. First impression, this console is HUGE. This is bigger than a Micro ATX sized PC. Performance wise, the system is super fast. Games load in mere seconds, something even PC can't do currently (DirectStorage and RTX IO will fix this). Graphics shine on my LG 27GN950-B gaming monitor and HDR really brings games to life. PS Plus also gives access to a bunch of games I missed from the previous generation (didn't play much of the PS4). I'm really excited to see where this system goes and how it will push forward PC gaming.",1,english
Sean,5,AMOUNT SOLD,the United States ,20201114,True,  Im literally curious how many were sold from Amazon. It looks like only a 100 to 200 were sold based on comments on launch day.

cdunn,5,Great console,the United States ,20201231,True,"  I purchased this generation of console, i have not had any major issues with it. I had an issue with the controller early on, it was sent to Sony and the replaced it quickly. No horror stories, so far so good. The games look fantastic and the media is fine. I am a little disappointed that there is no Dolby Atmos on the media content to feed back to my receiver but nothing i cannot live with. Overall I would strongly recommend the PS5.",0,english
J Dubb ,5,The Future is FAST.,the United States ,20201114,True,"  I was on Instagram around 6PM on 11/12 and Amazon sent me a notification that PS5 was in stock so I clicked the link and bought one! Less than 12 hours later it arrived and I didn’t even plan to buy one until 2021! The system itself is amazing, quiet & very fast! The Controllers are the best part. It has a nice weight and feel with a very long battery life, six plus hours for me in one sitting. Load times are almost non existent now as well. The small quality of life upgrades are well worth. Aesthetics in my opinion is very modern and futuristic. I can’t complain I just wanted more launch games. I’m so glad I bought one!",1,english

MattTop Contributor: Photography,5,"Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the next generation",the United States ,20201215,True,"  What a console. I haven't played video games in a while, and this was worth staying again for. Absolutely stunning graphics, super fast load times. Controller does crazy things. Super immersive and fun to play. Only downside would be if you're like me and are rural and have shotty internet coverage, you need a lot of data to play games, COD takes about 100GB and cyberpunk is another 50GB download. Overall, very worth it",0,english
Anthony Rubino,5,Seriously Amazing,the United States ,20201115,True,  When I finally was able to purchase it (within 2 seconds of mashing the add to cart button) I was so ecstatic. It arrived yesterday and I will say that it is seriously an amazing console. The new controller really needs to be used to understand why it is amazing. It really makes you feel the action you are doing in a game. The ps5 to me is very sleak and futuristic looking. It is large but not as ridiculous as everyone makes it seem to be. I've had every playstation in my life and I can confidently say this one is easily the best. Don't give up mashing the add to cart button the next time it's in stock. You won't regret it.,1,english

Joe,1,Stupid,the United States ,20201113,False,  I’m so sick of these companies purposefully limiting supply when launching new products to purposefully try and manufacture additional hype.

The UI at first was hard to go through as it was very different from the xbox one UI. After about 30 minutes though, it became very simple and easy to navigate throughout the home screen. The console is also very big but beautiful so it does even out the bad. The controller feels amazing in your hands and really is the future of gaming.

I'm really happy with the improvements that this console made with PS4 games running at a stable 60fps.It has also been quiet and doesn't seem to pump out as much heat as my old PS4 Pro. I do wish the unit was smaller, but that's the compromise right now.",0,english
Tishismyname,5,Play has no limits!,the United States ,20201125,True,"  Worth the wait! Great piece of hardware. Silky smooth UI, lighting fast load times, true 4K gaming experiences, and industry influencing innovations.

Jay,5,A true next gen experience!,the United States ,20201113,True,"  Wow. From the moment you open the box and see the console, you feel like you are in the future.

The 3D audio is crisp and loud, the controller is always moving, emulating every sensation occurring in the games, it truly takes immersion to the next level.",1,english
Damian Doty,5,Does Exactly What it Says on the Tin,the United States ,20201229,True,"  It’s exactly what I expected. Sony has been my go-to for gaming since the original PlayStation and though I have no specific love for their platform, nor dislike for others, I find that it suits my needs and delivers the games I care about most. It is indeed the next generation of consoles, and it proves it right out of the box.I would say that unless you need Demon’s Souls in your life right now, there’s no reason not to wait, and no reason to feel rushed. There is a lack of content that’s meant for the PS5 (as in, really, just a couple games) and nothing very compelling coming early 2021.",0,english
Jared Fite,5,Next Gen is Here,the United States ,20201113,True,"  4K + HDR + 60FPS = A next gen package at an affordable cost.

mknight2059,5,Next gen is here,the United States ,20201117,True,"  So far an amazing console. SSD and RTX built into a console is very nice. The only downside is the size of the console itself, but it's understandable why it is so big.",1,english
Chase,4,Loving it so far,the United States ,20201122,True,"  Got my system on launch day and couldn't be happier. Load times for PS5 games are super quick (within 2 seconds), and loading for the PS4 games that I've played on it are pretty much cut in half. I also love that I don't hear any noise coming from it. My PS4 sounded like a jet engine but this is quiet as a mouse for now. The way the PS Store is implemented is great as well.I do wish that they had kept the friends activity feed like the PS4 had and chat is now a little weird to figure out. The size is also a little awkward. Overall its a solid system and I'd recommend it. If you can get one then definitely grab Demon's Souls and Miles Morales, they're great.",0,english
Kurtis Pemberton,5,PS5...The Future of gaming has arrived.,the United States ,20201119,True,  Beautiful system!Fits in perfect and is anchored with an attachable base.The adaptive controllers with motion sensory takes gameplay to an entirely different level.I suggest playing the Astro game that comes with the system.

H12,5,The upgrade we needed,the United States ,20201226,True,"  I love the PS5, simply due to taking all the downsides of the PS4 Pro and correcting them.

The controler took me a bit to get used to since I came from Xbox but the learning curve is small and I'm really happy I decided to purchase a new gaming system and not a PC.,0,english
J. Mulkey,1,PS BS,the United States ,20201114,False,"  Forget it, I'll just drop some money into my PC. Sony knew this would happen and still let it.",23,english
Maverick ,5,Sony Has Done It Again!,the United States ,20201219,True,  What to say? It is AWESOME! Truly next level gaming at it's finest by the best in the business. Quality is crisp! Make sure you have a viable 4K TV to play this on and not some cheap low quality trash like ONN.,2,english
jesse ,5,PS5,the United States ,20210123,True,  I love it!  So glad I got my hands on this console for retail price... I LOVE YOU AMAZON.  Xbox series x has nothing on this!!!,1,english
Raymond,4,Great console but not worth the price as of now..,the United States ,20201228,True,"  The PS5 over the past few months has been near impossible to buy for retail. I had the chance to get it and to be frank, I’m not that stoked about it. I bought and played spiderman miles as well as the remastered but once I played those two games, I was somewhat just stuck with the console. IMO, besides spiderman, there are no good games out for the PS5. I say to hold on until next year for new games to come out if you’re considering buying it from a reseller, or even for retail. You can definitely save those 600 dollars and save it, especially during a time like this.",0,english
Fox Die,5,Worth the purchase..if you get that far atleast.,the United States ,20210108,True,"  So far the system runs great playing both PS4 and PS5 games, definitely worth the purchase and a noticeable improvement over both PS4 Pro and XB1X(not to be confused with Series X, don't have one or really care about getting one anytime soon to compare) if you ever get the chance to actually get the thing.Minor complaint is with the shipping, I got it a day late and was told I'd have $10 in-store credit that I just tried to use when checking out which wasn't there but other than that I'm satisfied with the system and Amazon getting it to me within a week.",0,english
Alicebroussard7,5,Wow the difference between Ps4 and Ps5 is night and day glad i was able to grab one with no issues,the United States ,20210106,True,  Incredible graphics really does live up to the hype oh and dont change shipping speed i changed mine from 5 day to 2 day and shipping time was extended by 2 days double check for free 2 day shipping quickly before checkout .,0,english
KC,5,Great Console!,the United States ,20201224,True,"  Was pretty tough to get, but luckily I saw it in stock in the middle of the night and was able to get this amazing console.

crystal,5,11yr old Over The Moon happy!,the United States ,20201218,True,"  My son received this for excellent grades, to say the least since Winter Break started he has been on it nonstop. He loves it, after upgrading from a PS3. The graphics are “out of this world”. He has indicated that some download issues have occurred, but were resolved very quickly. I am pleased/grateful that I was able to purchase this from Amazon, as ALL other outlets were sold out from the beginning.",0,english
marszciano,5,Pure speed,the United States ,20210106,True,"  True upgrade over PS4.. lighting fast, can deliver 4k 60 frames. Can even do 120 frames. Already a ton of great games due to back compat. More classics surely to come as well. If you can get one it’s well worth every cent.",0,english
Konrad Patrzalek,4,"This console is a beast, but not really any new next gen title.",the United States ,20210121,True,"  I got this because I wanted something new, and next gen. I also wanted to play cyber punk, but turns out the game is hot garbage for the game. My PS5 is constantly locking up, especially when I play spiderman, if the system goes to sleep while paused, I will have to retart and rebuild. Gets kinda annoying maybe it will be good once they get the kinks out.",0,english
TreQuan Chavis,4,It real!!!,the United States ,20201230,True,  It’s not a scam I feel bad I payed this much for it but I got it for those thinking about getting it either you can try harder next year or take a chance now they are going to come out with a black one anyways and their is 10000000000000 people who still are trying to get it if you wanna wait by all means but it’s real!!!I got mines,1,english

Alvin Merino,5,Amazing,the United States ,20201127,True,  What an amazing console!!! Technology keeps getting better and it shows!!!!,1,english
Heri,5,The controller A1!,the United States ,20201218,True,  Honestly the best part about this is the controller. Very interactive and has good feedback. The console specs are good but is lacking a larger selection of next gen games. Obviously that will be remedied with time,1,english
Thomasbusacca,4,85% good 15% decent,the United States ,20210106,True,"  Fun console, great remote, lightning fast, small storage.

Shanice,5,Worth every penny!,the United States ,20210103,True,  For those who were able to get their hands on the Ps5 know this is definitely worth every penny. The dualsense controller is a game changer and I really hope they keep incorporating its potential for future games. Don't lose hope in trying to get one for those who are still struggling and DEFINITELY DO NOT give into the scalpers it's just not worth it. Patience is a virtue ,0,english
Lou,5,Worth buying,the United States ,20210105,True,  Definitely worth the wait. I for mine almost 2 months after release and it took some time to do but the console and the games are absolutely amazing. I'd definitely recommend to a playstation fan or to someone who hasn't had a playstation before or in a while. The playstation plus collection and ps+ is a good way to get some of the last gens best games and it's all for a playstation plus subscription. Lots of fun.,0,english
LaSelle,5,Big difference from PS4 to PS5,the United States ,20210110,True,"  Looks good, feels good, plays great! Load times are much faster especially with Destiny 2. Can’t wait to play more games down the line. ",2,english
Jeff A. Elder,5,Definitely faster than the PS4,the United States ,20201224,True,  The PS5 is a console that has lots of speed and intelligence that makes gaming very enjoyable. The fast start up and smooth gameplay puts gaming laptops to shame finally. A must have console,0,english
Frank,4,Almost dead,the United States ,20201112,True,  It's been great so far except for the fact that it all of a sudden stopped working and my controller stopped working as well and I had to unplug it to make it shut off and then come back on and it worked fine for me after that but still was kinda scary that it happened hopefully it doesn't happen again,1,english
dabuereto,5,Great console (if you can get your hands on it),the United States ,20210108,True,"  Everything works amazing, great console if you could avoid scalpers and get it for retail. Everything came as described although the delivery took around 1-2 weeks. The controller is honestly my favorite controller I’ve held and the game selection although small, comes out swinging.",1,english
Austin G,5,Exceeded my expectations,the United States ,20201222,True,  Totally exceeded my expectations! Awesome machine and at the hight of a game the console runs so smooth and quiet. PS4 games run way smoother and PS5 games will blow you away and so so quite compared to my PS4 Pro it barley buzzes the disk rpm is louder than the system that's how quite it is,0,english

The design is nice, sort of grows on you. The quality of the games I have played so far are rather nice and comparable to a decent mid ranged gaming pc. I wouldn't call it a PC Killer, but one heck of an upgrade for couch gaming!",0,english
Steven G,4,Solid Console but...,the United States ,20201117,True,"  The console is well made, and solid but a number of issues that will likely be fixed in later firmware updates make the current product 4 instead of 5 stars. Data transfer issues, external hard drives potentially causing corruption issues, rest mode sometimes causing corruption issues all of which have a tiny chance of bricking your new console are just no good.",0,english
Noah Maples,5,The next generation of gaming is here!,the United States ,20201207,True,"  Awesome console. The graphics are really nice, the Dualsense adaptive feedback and Haptic triggers add immersion to the gameplay. Miles Morales Spider man is a lot of fun and trims our some of the fat of the original and Astros Playroom is an excellent controller showpiece. It also plays ps4 game greats and makes your games look a little nicer if you never owned a ps4 pro like me. The console is totally worth the $500 if you can find one lol.",0,english
Derron,1,The disappointment I have for SCE is beyond words.,the United States ,20201115,False,"  Wow. Just wow, Sony. You hype up and CONTINUE to hype up a console that admittedly looks amazing, yet most of the population who want one can't even GET one. Let alone multiple. And Amazon, you're just as at fault, with your terrible ""notification"" system that never EVER worked ONCE. God, this is pitiful, but why should the companies care? They get money one way or another so who cares, right?",22,english

Amazon Customer,1,Playstation 5 is a fail!,the United States ,20201116,False,"  First to those complaining about the shortages of Systems.......Do you honestly believe they simply couldn't meet demand?Hahaha, why would they bother to fill every order when they could create a variety of accounts and sell 1000's of systems for 2-3 times the retail price.Should I upgrade to the PlayStation 5?There is really no point in upgrading to the PlayStation 5. WHY? Because it is a rip off.You'll never notice a difference in speed or capability,(unless of course you sit there and focus solely on that) I know, I know it has an SSD but guess what you can add an SSD to the PlayStation 4 and if you do that for a fraction of the price guess what its is the same.It has far better graphics right?Sadly not really. It is capable of rendering more shadows and lighting effects but a lot of that is driven by the game design and while its true the PS5 is better equipped to handle the ""better graphics"" lets face it, a whole new system just to say WOW that beam of light looks so cool is pretty sad.Its new controllers helps you feel like your part of the game right?Well since the controller could have been easily upgraded for the PS4 to include the new mechanisms you really can't count that as some sort of benefit especially with a significantly higher price tag for a device that is not more expensive than the original.Ultimately this system is just to get more money out of people for no real gain. Think I'm just spouting non-sense? Well..... a Digital system for $400 and an identical system for $500 just with a disk drive????? Does anyone actually believe the Disk drive cost them anywhere near $100. It is not anything special it is just an optical drive, it probably cost them $5. A big factor is they want people to go digital. Why you ask? Because they can charge the same price and not bother with the costs of a physical copy and there is no re-selling it to someone else which means others will have to buy it if they want it.So Here is the bottom line. I would buy it in a heart beat if it actually did something worth while. For example if it was fully backward compatible, then hell yes I would buy that. That would be a worth while upgrade. But they don't so they can drive their streaming game service. They could easily make the systems fully backwards compatible at little to no extra cost, but why do all that when there are ways to rip people off.",19,english

You know the people that have supported Sony by not only buying the PS4 but having a plus membership and have spent thousands of dollars in games too!? Sounds like an easy way of taking care of your loyal customers to me! Instead let's sell thousands to bots who have no reason to buy one other than to turn around and sell them @ eye watering amounts! Saw one sell for  $3200.00. F.U Sony! None of you care as long as they are flying off the shelves... not real shelves but virtual. Wait... you don't even need virtual shelves!? More like virtual pallets where you can't even get the virtual shrink rap off before people start fighting to get at them....virtually. Yes I'm a little salty.... F.U.

A huge bunch of BIG MAJOR NAMES that cant keep up with Demands? These 3 boys watched me on Walmart with the button saying ""ADD TO CART"" And it would not go. For 2 hours. Then it finally said sold out.As much money as I spend on Amazon yearly, and everything Microsoft. Sony with their 40 page sign this contract, Crap?I've got 2- 2012 pcs I've nursed and are all updated. I try to teach these boys, who were ABANDONED by their parents 9 years ago, that Education is key!Remember, MONEY BURNS, it's only paper.So all you BIG companies, you broke alot of hearts,  crushed alot of spirits,  in these kids comments!

ARE a Special kind of Slow if you buy this or Any product for X5 the price off a Scalper.  Absolute Insanity.Pass the legislation. Scalping IS a Crime that Needs to be an Offical Capital Offense. with No parole.Consoles Should be sold and TRACKED. 1 - 2 PER Household. NOBODY needs More than that. Literally. Not even if you live in a house with 7 kids. everyone gets 2. The Fact Someone out there is able to buy 5 - 10 and Up by a bot tracker with no recoil. is Digustingly shameful.I Demand NO ONE Buy from Them. Period. They NEED to Lose Money and go broke homeless and Hungry for their Idiocy. and Greeeed.If You Dare to spend Over 2,000 + $ on this new gen garbage from a grifter you are even More insane than they are. and that is not the kind of mad world i want to live in.

Socratez,1,What a Joke!,the United States ,20201226,False,  I have spent countless hours and days trying to buy 1 online for my home just to enjoy playing and have failed at every chance I’ve tried. It is extremely frustrating that scalpers can be allowed to use specific software to hog up these units for outrageous profits! There should be a limit put on these units to stop this ridiculous scheme. Yes I also blame Sony for contributing to this mess. They knew very well the demand would be high for these units. I am “not” going to pay 3x the amount for a unit and will just wait. I do not think it’s right to make people search + 100 hours and over a month just to try a buy a PS5 Unit!

G Ninja,1,From a long time Sony fan,the United States ,20201118,False,"  Why does Sony choose to support scalpers and not fans? Fans just want to get their hands on it to play and enjoy it.

They also give little to no information about stock and just want you to waste your time staring at a screen and refreshing their website.

I don’t think PlayStation did their math correctly, yes they made their money this year because all ps5 have been sold out to very few and a lot of scalpers but next year there will be a big drop in online player base and subscription. Also thanks Amazon for letting this happen. Just not going to get one and get a PC. DO NOT BUY these ps5 at 3x price. Regardless the ps5 will forever be going to be release for the next 7yrs until ps6 lol. Patient is key on buying a console.

It is apparent they could care less about loyal Playstation supporters. The preorders were straight consumed by scalpers. Now at launch retailers have less than scraps. Then theres playstation direct online. Youd think was the best way to procure a console direct from as Sony? Wrong again!!!! They go online at any random hour of the day with no prewarning. You sit in a que for 45 min only to be greeted with the same OUT OF STOCK messege you started with. I have done this 4 times and counting. Want to reach an actual person at Sony. They make that impossible as they know people are VERY upset about this. So you tell me you produce millions of consoles knowing demand is up in a pandemic, and previous launch shortage failures, and still botch a release? This is so intentional. You want to tell me with todays tech you cant see exactly which people were in your online que failing to get a console and you cant contact them and take the order directly? Sony is messy and sloppy as it gets.",10,english
Michael C. Davis II,5,STOP CRYING,the United States ,20201220,False,"  I'm sorry but the amount of crying over folks selling the PS5 and/or Xbox Series X for more than what its sold for in stores is ridiculous. It's simple economics. Supply is low, and demand is high, therefore markup is inevitable. There's price inflation on EVERYTHING WE PURCHASE. Most of you are paying a mortgage and paying 3 times more than what the actual house is worth. You are wearing shoes that cost 5 times more than it took to actually make the shoe. Hell, the food you eat is way overpriced but you pay for it. It's simple. Either complain about everything being overpriced or shut up. You're simply mad that you didn't get one.....PLAIN AND SIMPLE. If you were fortunate enough to get one you wouldn't be here complaining about the inflated price, and instead would be sitting in front of the TV enjoying your new purchase. So sick of you crying, OVERPRIVILEDGED BRATS!!!!!",9,english
nosympathy,1,Failures all around,the United States ,20201119,False,"  There are a few tech companies that handle releases of new products very well. Like Apple for instance. They usually do a pretty good job even though I'm not a fan.This has been terrible. Not a single place has used any form of anti-bot tech at all. Notifications are never on time, if you can even get notified. It's 2020, things should not be this bad. Other smaller businesses for years have required captchas to place orders. Not any of the big guys!Maybe even with a captcha in place, i'd still get beat out for one. Which would be fine, at least it would feel like I had a fair chance. Right now, I doubt there are many people feeling this way. The ones who do manage to snag a console are just super lucky or they are scalpers.This big retailers don't care, but scalpers are the worst people to exist right now. Seeing these units go for $1800+ in some areas (like mine)  and as some other reviews mentioned, $1800+ can build a realllllly nice PC that will make the PS5 look like garbage. There is no way I'd buy a PS5 for that, it's just counter productive at that point. It's a really nice machine for $400-500, but that's where it stops.",8,english

I am not paying scalpers 3x or more for a unit that cost $499 no way ever! Sony and Microsoft are seriously hurting their fan base as are the retailers like Amazon and best buy and target and Walmart. Absolutely garbage!!!

Will,1,disgrunted consumer,the United States ,20201117,False,"  Its ridiculous that Sony couldn't make enough or plan for the demand when the gaming market is at an all time high. We have been waiting for these consoles for years only to not get notified for preorders, not get notified when in stock or even be given and eta on more systems. I love my PS4, but Im trying to give my money to Amazon or whatever company that can get one. These things are not worth 1200, 1500, or 2500 dollars. Im more or less disgusted by the fact the retailers have let people buy multiple systems at once. Take a not from the gun market limits need to be in place.",10,english

Sumit Purkayastha,1,Worst launch in the history,the United States ,20201229,False,"  Shame on Sony. Such a famous tech company and they had 7 years to prepare for the unleashing of PS5 and they produced such a small number of consoles that we are trying for months and waking up at 5 in the morning, refreshing the pages over and over again. Still we can't get one. Even I could get into the Target drop and added to cart and everything, still at the end it failed because of selling out. I mean, what a joke. Such a big company and they knew that the demand would be high, why didn't they produce enough number of ps5s, or they wanted to make the scalpers profitable? Some people are getting 2-3 or even more - disc, digital both and we keep refreshing the pages and waiting to see any notification and still can't get one even after getting into the order page. Worst launch of all time!!",8,english
Kyle P. Bayuk,1,Way overhyped,the United States ,20201224,False,"  I have every Nintendo and every Playstation and have them all hooked up and ready to play anytime I want.  The PS5 is definitely not worth the hype.  The graphics and speed are only incrementally better than the PS4 and on top of that the UI is laggy and is about the same speed as well. The build quality is for crap as well.  I don’t know if it’s me, but the system still gets very hot and is as loud as the PS4 was, if not more.  I don’t know what they were talking about with the haptic feedback being better.  I did not notice any difference between the PS4 and this.  Since I have both systems hooked up I turned both on and was switching back and forth and did not notice and discernable difference on any of the items I just went into.  So, I’m not sure what Sony was talking about when they said it was a huge improvement.  They definitely hyped this system up way too much and it does not live up to it.  This is the biggest disappointment since I got Gran Turismo Sport.  When I got that I put it in the system once and realized what it was.  So, I took it out and put it up on the shelf and there it has sat since the game has come out.  I will more than likely being doing the same thing with this thing.  If you must have it, I would wait a couple years for them to at least fix all the technical issues.  But, by that time the PS5 Pro will be out and then you would have to wait a couple more years for the bugs to be worked out on that as well and then by that time it would be better to just wait until the PS6 comes out.  Honestly this is not a good generation for gaming consoles as whole, especially the PS5.  So, if I were you I would wait until the PS6.  Hopefully they get their act together by then, otherwise I feel as if game consoles won’t last.  I will say it again, this is the biggest let down since Gran Turismo Sport.",7,english
CT,1,Disappointed,the United States ,20210104,False,  It’s crazy how people are taking advantage of the demand on this console. Why is Sony & Amazon allowing people to buy multiple consoles so people who really want it to play it can’t get it I’ve been trying for since the release to get one I’m not paying double for it,10,english
Stacey Nave,1,Heartbroken for my children,the United States ,20201118,False,  This is absolutely disgusting to do to people in the middle of a pandemic.

PolskaPride,1,LASTED TWO DAYS!!!,the United States ,20201119,False,"  I am so fed up with Sony and their so called ""customer service"".  It's obvious that the unit I received was defective.  I was told by several sources to have the console in a vertical position.  I set up the stand and secured it.  The first day, no problems but on the second day there was definitely a louder sound I heard coming from the console.  It wasn't exactly loud but I did not hear it on day one so I was a little concerned.  On day two the console froze to the point that I had to restart it numerous times.  It has been doing that ever since but more frequently giving me an error message.  The last time I played, it froze three times within a 40 minute span.  This is supposed to be a new console (was it?) and I am experiencing issues from the beginning.  At this point I say save yourself the aggravation and invest elsewhere.  Also, I did not know that this console would be so big!  It sticks out like a sore thumb because of its size and design.  Extremely disappointed.. this one is going to be returned shortly.  I guess the joke was on me, but not for long.",6,english
Roy A. Teel Jr.,2,$$$ PS5 Review to date ITS LONG BUT A MUST READ!,the United States ,20201225,False,"  Okay, I, like so many who have written on this site, tried desperately to get a PS5 on pre-order in September but it didn’t happen. I was on Amazon, Sony, and the list goes on but the bots got them and anyone who has been on eBay knows what I’m talking about. I did however, put in an order for a PS5 through an “Available from these sellers” link on Amazon on November 12th but when I got to the links I was shocked at the pricing, the sellers were on eBay, StockX all over the place and prices were out of this world. Disc units were going for up to $2000 USD, and digital the same. I ended up hooked up with a seller however, through Amazon, even after Amazon killed the link. You can still buy ALL of the accessories for the PS5 on Amazon from, “Available from these sellers” from the three D headphones to remotes cameras etc. and they are ALL brokers but not PS5’s. So, when I learned that the units are hopelessly out of stock and most likely won’t be in stock until next May or June, I bit the bullet and bought an all-digital unit for $999.First impressions, if Sony was looking to release a twenty-first century looking unit, they missed the mark by sixty-five years. If this unit were released at Disney Land in tomorrow land in 1955 it would have worked but in 2020 NOPE. My wife looked at it when I put it on the TV stand on its side as that’s how I use my units and she said, “It looks smushed, did someone sit on it or did it melt?” I could not help myself I just started laughing because the unit itself is UGLY.Size and shell construction, the unit weighs fourteen pounds, and is double the size of the PS4 it is incredibly quiet when running but it’s massive and takes up a lot of space. The shell looks terrible the white shell is very, very thin plastic if you drop this you WILL break it, the inner black is shiny but Sony would have been better off going all black. I understand they need to cool the components but aesthetically the unit is ugly.On the front of the unit there is a standard USB 2.0 and a high-speed USB 3.0. On the back you have power, the HDMI out for video and audio to the TV and ethernet hub (I don’t know why Sony did this everything is wireless these days) then two USB 2.0 high speed hubs there is NO optical input/output on the PS5 for headphones and PS5 does NOT support Bluetooth audio yet again.The unit is supposed to come with an internal one TB SSD drive that’s not what you get, its actually about 690 GHZ and if you download your PS4 games to it you will eat up the drive in a flash, no pun intended. So, you need an external drive, however, here is where the money starts adding up. The unit itself is cheap but all you get is the system and one controller and if you’re a gamer like me, you need more than one controller and a lot more stuff, and that runs up the tab so you better have a lot of cash to invest in this system.Sony says you can use your HDD from your PS4 on the PS5 to play your PS4 games NOT SO, the PS5 does NOT read the HDD so forget about it I tried every work around I could (I was on YouTube for hours looking and nothing) the system would not recognize any of my HDD drives. So, I invested in a Samsung 1 TB SSD drive $200 bucks you’re going to need this and you’re going to need an even bigger drive. I have looked at other SSD drives and for a five TB SSD it is about $600 so get ready to put out a lot more cash for this system. Given the sheer size of games coming to the console in the coming months and years one TB might hold only one or two games.Speed: Load speeds are okay, when I load GTA Online with my high-speed internet it takes about forty seconds. Now that is fast when you consider on PS4 it takes about a minute to a minute and a half or longer as Rockstar advertises in game stuff during the load. I’m sure that Rockstar and Take Two Interactive will find a way to slow the process when they release the new GTA Online later next year. In game frame rate changes, fast and clean however, the system moves a little too fast for a lot of PS4 games like Hitman, Assassins Creed Call of Duty and the list goes one so the images can get blurry. I thought it was my vision at first but it’s not, the PS5 moves so fast the games can’t load as fast as the processor in the PS5 can bus the data.Picture: I went all out before buying the PS5 and invested in a brand new 2020 75” Samsung QLED 800 Smart Ultra 8K TV. The TV converts anything to HD and to 4K and it has a game mode setting on it to improve the look of games so I really see little difference between my games from PS4 to PS5. However, if you don’t have at least a 4K TV you’re wasting your money on this system, the PS5 is designed for 4K and can be upgraded (at an extra cost) to 8K which I did by purchasing high speed 8K HDMI cables $90. So, beware if you’re going to go in on this system you better be prepared to put out at least another one to two thousand dollars if you go low end with the TV and accessories, if you go high end like I did, well, let’s just say I’m in now about $5K. However, while the in-game picture and graphics are GREAT if you want to watch a movie or video the quality of the images goes down hill fast. The system darkens the video and I have done every possible fix I can on the PS5 and nothing works. However, if I go over to my PS4 the picture is GREAT so it definitely has something to do with the PS5 video cards but I have no idea what it is I hope Sony will release a patch for this but as of now I can’t stream movies or TV shows on PS5, at and at least not enjoy them.Audio: Sony has been touting their custom 3D audio and they have released a new pair of headphones just for this new audio. A word of warning, this audio ONLY works with select games, as of right now the only game I have that it works with is Assassins Creed Valhalla, if you use the 3D audio settings for other games the sound sucks plain and simple. The Sony headphones are going to set you back another $100 so be prepared for that. All in all, on the audio I’m not impressed at ALL either on my TV or my headphones. I use regular settings on my phones and the sounds is as good as on my PS4 so to me the 3D build is hype perhaps some reading this can tell me if they have found a way to use the 3D audio successfully.Overall impression of the PS5? Not impressed, for a next gen console and all the hype that Sony has put out on this it really is no big deal. In the end when the units are plentiful and everyone can get their hands on one Sony is going to make bank not on the systems but the accessories, I know there are bugs still to work out but a month and a half in I wish I would have saved my money and waited until spring.",4,english
Troy,2,Keep calm and wait like everyone else.,the United States ,20201114,False,"  What I dislike about it? Well launching a console without the numbers to support public demand.

Try to put my zip code and the system does not let me go through. Discriminating? Its a shame, after many years the island has being a consumer and supporter of the Sony brand overall, not only PS products. They came and go to the island to import and do business as they like.  As many companies  and brands has done in the past. There only interests are there's interests, no the interests and respect of the consumers in the island and around the world. Thats is the second class or even third class US citizenship we have here in the island.

I own both this and the Series X and I can say that overall the SX is superior as far as interface speed, slightly faster loading times and better graphics on almost all backwards compatibility games. They don't look bad on PS5, games like AC Origins, Odyssey, Crash 4 etc. And they have a nice clarity to them. But they really lack certain textures and the color gamut is very pale in comparison. imo. Now when you're talking exclusives (from PS4) PS5 is the way to go, all the PS4 titles look amazing as they did on PS4/Pro. I think most of these games have received special ""treatment"" other 3rd party titles have not. And Sony just have the worlds best exclusives bar none.  But until actual titles made just for the PS5 are released, and not for the PS4/Pro. I can't recommend it. Because once you play these games you sit and go, well, now what? So I'd recommend holding onto your pro, since these are scarce anyway, and just wait. The same can be said for the Xbox Series X, but then again games pass just kills it, tons of free games, and if you're more of a 3rd party title person. it's just a no brainer. So the hype isn't that real about the PS5, it is a ""good"" system, but I think in the future it will be great!! Also all the problems people say they've had or are having with this, I'm not experiencing any. Super quiet, cool and not a single glitch.",2,english

Just, like...a simple concept, I know...I do plan on purchasing, and I am a fan of Playstation.

Shahzad Soonawalla,2,Demand over Supply. Unbalanced.,the United States ,20201115,False,"  Most of the reviews are about the console’s inventory and retail release criticisms. As gamers, we are confident in the PS5’s capabilities. That’s not the issue. The issue is that they are under stocked on the consoles as they are taken by surprise of the high demand that outweighs the supply. I understand that it takes a lot of time and money to mass produce multiple PS5 copies, but why give it out to specific groups if it’s meant to be played by all?

Samuel Clemens,4,A next gen console with real growing pains,the United States ,20201118,False,"  I'm going to summarize all the good then get to the bad (growing pains).THE GOOD:Improved UI and User Settings -I'm shocked how much thought was put into the user experience. There are global settings for compatible games ranging from default difficulty settings in your games (easy, normal, hard), adjusting surround sound (or 3D) audio for your ears specifically, preferencing either higher-resolution or faster frame-rate modes alongside everything you could change from the PS4's settings menus (turning off menu music, controlling sleep modes, dimming the controller's lights, etc.). I'm assuming user settings may get more granular over time, but I'm impressed at launch.Much Faster Load Times -You may have seen it from various PS5 previews, but the load times for most games I'm playing are easily under a minute. I'm not noticing any load screens, making play sessions much more cohesive and convenient. Is it the most incredible thing? I'm older now and used to loading screens, so not for me, but assuming most people will gladly welcome this feature.Boosted PS4 Game Performance -This is so so for me. Unless you can measure resolutions and frame rates with just your eyes, you may not notice which games and how much your PS5 is improving your backward-compatible PS4 games. Some PS4 games are getting nearly twice the frame rate boost, but it varies so much from game to game that you have to research each title you're playing to figure out how your PS5 may or may not be boosting its performance.Crazy Good PlayStation Plus Value -I have friends who still don't subscribe to PlayStation Plus, and if they get a PS5, it will baffle me if they didn't get a Plus subscription. If you get PlayStation Plus on the PS5, you'll get a list of PS4 games included. It's a relatively long list, and no, they're not throw-away PS4 titles. Going through the list, I've played most of those games and can tell you that they are some of the best videogames (not just PS4 games) I have ever played. If you've never played Bloodborne, and have a PS5, start playing it now.Those Graphics! -Watch trailers for these games: Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, Demon's Souls for PS5, Final Fantasy XVI, Horizon: Forbidden West, and Spiderman: Miles Morales. We don't have a trailer for God of War: Ragnarök yet, but that game is coming in 2021. Those games are either timed exclusives or just exclusive for the PS5. Demon's Souls and Miles Morales are the only games out right now. I'm playing Demon's Souls, and it's the best-looking game I've ever played. Also, because the PS5 is HDMI 2.1 compliant, it should run some games at 4K 60 FPS or 1080p 120 FPS or something in-between. There isn't support for a native 1440p resolution (which is dumb), but I'm assuming that's coming later.THE BAD:Availability -You can't buy it right now. This is obvious and an issue that all companies and genuine consumers are dealing with this year. Online scalpers, limited availability, and the need to have something to do while stuck indoors is destroying available stock. I want to blame Sony (and should), but many popular product launches have been nearly impossible to obtain this year.The Console's Size -The PS5 is offensively huge, and you, for some reason, are required to use the included stand for both horizontal and vertical orientations. Between the console, it's included stand, the PS5 Dual sense charger, and the PS5 dual sense controller - all these devices barely fit into my setup. I'm squeezing them in.Confusing Backwards Compatibility -Yes, the PS5 plays PS4 physical and digital games, but there are three variations. There are PS4 games you play on your PS5, PS4 games enhanced through PS5 updates and/or boosted performance, and PS5 versions of PS4 games you've previously purchased...what? You can't store PS5 games on any external drives (SSD, NVME, or HDD), so that makes me wonder if I can play the PS5 version of PS4 games on an external drive. You can play regular PS4 games and PS4 games boosted by the PS5 on an external drive. That's about as much sense as I can make of this.Small Storage and No Options for Internal Storage Expansion -The PS5 has 667 GBs of usable storage straight out of the box. That sounds like a lot until you start downloading PS5 games and realize you can download about 5-6 digital PS5 games before maxing out. The launch does seem a little rushed since you're also unable to expand that internal storage and, as mentioned previously, can only store PS4 games on an external drive. There will need to be a future firmware update on the PS5 and upcoming 1st and 3rd party compatible NVME internal storage drives before that 667 GBs of storage can be expanded.Conclusion:I haven't had any issues with my PS5. Buying it was unnecessarily stressful, but beyond that, it's been a relatively smooth experience. I've seen horror stories on social media and through the news but haven't experienced any problems others seem to be having. I don’t regret purchasing a PS5, especially with all the exclusive PS5 titles I'm looking forward to. But please don't buy a PS5 off online scalpers; it's not worth the prices they're posting on those websites.Thanks for reading.-SC",1,english

The Dude Abides,4,It's really big.,the United States ,20201119,False,"  I didn't get mine on Amazon...I tried, but it disappeared from my cart every time.  Same with Walmart.  Best Buy was the worst (shocking, I know).  I got lucky and saw a link to Target and when I clicked on the link it took me to the app that had all of my wife's info already loaded - I added it and checked out within 15 seconds.  FedEx gets zero stars for their abysmal delivery...said I'd get it on 11/14, then they changed it to 11/15, then they changed it to 11/16, when I finally got it.  I'm boycotting them.Boy, it's really big.  Like I couldn't believe how big it was when I unboxed it.  Compared to the PS4, it's a monster.  I had it mounted vertically, but it was too distracting and I'm not going to stick it in a cabinet, so it's horizontal now, even though it looks better upright.  But I guess being really big makes it really fast.  And when I say fast, I mean it.  I have AT&T fiber with 1000 up/down, but downloading on my PS4 was insanely slow, even with a fast, wired connection.  Downloading Warzone to the PS5 took a few minutes - on PS4, it took an hour at least, if not longer.  Downloading system and game updates take seconds.  I'm guessing it has a faster internet card in it, but the writing time to the SSD is lightening quick.  Then there's the load times for games - I mean, I don't have a lot of time.  I have 3 kids, 2 dogs, am married....if my wife goes up to take a shower, I'd bust out the PS4 controller and try to get in a few MW matches and half the time, I'd fire it up and have to do an update, and load the game, and join a lobby and by time I got into a match, she'd be back downstairs.  That's not going to be the case with PS5.  Updates, fast.  Boot up, fast.  In game, fast.  Actually have a shot of some pew pew in those 20 minute timeslots.The CONTROLLER!!!!  So, you get Astro's playroom for free.  My kids love it, first off.  It really does show off the capabilities of what the controller can do - it's Super Mario-esque.  Very cool to play around with once or twice though.  I bought COD as my first game.  I have to say, on campaign mode, it really adds to the experience.  Each gun (so far) has a totally different feel to it.  When you pull a trigger on a real gun, there's an initial wiggle before you catch the spring - and that's the case in this game too.  And with each gun I've tried, the trigger pull feels a little different.  But, for MP, I feel like it's a disadvantage.  You squeeze those triggers and have to be very deliberate because of the resistance, so in MP, where you have to react quickly, esp if you play hardcore like me, I think it's a disadvantage.  I haven't looked to see if it can be turned off, but I think you can.  One thing about the controller is that Sony makes you plug it in to do updates to it, which is kinda cool.  It's also heavier than the DS4, but it feels really good in your hand.  It has a mic built in, so you don't need to wear a headset - and there's a mute button on the controller, which is cool.  Battery life isn't great...maybe with updates to it they can improve on that???????PS4 games!!!!  So, you really don't need a PS4, but you can do remote play with it, so move it to another room!!  Plug in your PS4 HD into the PS5 and everything will load - but I find not as fast as the PS5 games.  Maybe because its loading from an external HD, not an internal SSD.  But, after playing COD on PS5, going into Warzone is a bit of a letdown without the haptics and triggers reacting.  So, while the PS4 games play just fine, the load slower and are disappointing now that I've played the PS5 version of Black Ops.Black Ops - I did order this from Amazon.  It is NOT worth $70.  But, it's one of the best looking games I've ever played.  And I haven't gotten a 4K TV yet - that's what Santa is bringing, so I have to wait.  So, it looks amazing in 1080p, it'll look extraordinary in 4K.  MP is meh...only like 8 maps, 3 or 4 of which were in the Beta/Alpha.  I haven't played Zombies yet.  But Campaign on this game is good - I'm just a mission in.  So much to explore, download, set up, etc on the console, I've spent more time doing that than playing games - so far.PS+ games - you get a bunch of free PS4 games, so you get a solid library of games, but they're not PS5 games, so the controller is feedback doesn't happen, so they're a little disappointing.  The issue is that you only have 825GB of storage space and with the OS on it, you really have like 675GB for games and apps.  So, you can't fit a ton of games on the PS5 overall.  But, like I said, if you have a decent connection, it's not a big deal - delete/download/play/delete, repeat.  I mean, for me, the downloads are so freaking fast, I don't think it's that big of a deal.  Plus I don't have a cap on my internet plan.  I like getting the disks...but probably could have gotten the digital version.So far, there's really only one thing I don't like.  On PS4, you pressed and held the PS button and you could turn it off from there.  Pretty easy.  Now, you have to hit the PS button, scroll all the way over, hit power and then hit rest or power down.  It's maybe an extra button or two, but still.  The UI overall isn't too dissimilar from PS4, but you have to hit the PS button to pull up the home screen options vs double tapping it like you do in PS4, which I think is faster.  I'm nitpicking, really.  It's fine - and it's quick.  I also don't like the USB ports on the front - I wish they were all on the back - it's kinda ugly with wires sticking out of the front. There are 2 USB ports on the back and just 1 on the front.  I think its a USB-C port on the front - maybe for a external HD??  Wish it was just a normal USB port, but at least this unit has more than the 2 that PS4 had - 1 to charge the controller, 1 for your headset and 1 for your external hard drive.  That's an improvement over the PS4 for sure.PS Store - it's now an app on it's own.  It's very quick - no load time to get into it, whatsoever, like we saw on PS4.Be patient...I'm sure Sony is doing what they can to pump these things out to everyone stuck in lockdowns.  I got super lucky I got one - I'm the only one of my close friends and family that has one.  When you do get one, it'll be worth it.  Stupid BOTS are snatching them up and stores aren't carrying them.  Good luck.  It's a solid purchase - a lot of hardware for $500 or $400 if you get the digital version.",1,english

IT Developer 2028,5,"One heck of a NexGen Console, and worth the wait.",the United States ,20201116,False,"  Ok right now it's kinda tuff to get one. True. This is the same old game and should never come as a surprise. Every launch happens like this regardless of the platform. [Xbox or PS5].  (A) There's a need (B) The initial supply is limited (C) The resellers come in and make a huge profit outa greed.  Then the balloon bursts after about 6 months to a year after the holidays. Prices stabilize after the initial big wow factor is gone. Buyers after-taste sets in after they realize they paid for two or three consoles for one that was not worth that much. So what of it, heck that'll never change. Be patient and hang on to your money until after the big bad I gotta have it rush and get the console ""at cost [399/499]"". You've waited this long, why not just a little bit further and save yourself grief and a ton of cash that you'd never get back.  The final reality of it is that it will probably be a while regardless until developers learn how to truly harness the power of the PS5. Just look at the UnReal Engine 5 release, using that platform will take a year or two a minimum. So this minor wait won't deter me, but I'm reasonable also with my hard earned money.",1,english
NasTraDooMis,4,Carbon fiber gears of war 3 wrapped ps5 !,the United States ,20201119,False,"  Wrapped me ps5 in carbon fiber and did a little gears of war 3 theme to it. I even  put a GOW3 skull behind the Ps emblem . It was quiet the chore to wrap it due to the curvatures and it didnt turn out so hot, but not too bad until some other themed skinned covers come out. The ps5 i dont think is too honkin big as alot of peeps are freaking out about, i mean yea its big but whatever. The included Astros playground game is ok, i wasnt too overtly impressed, the new controls to me are a bit ""funky"". The annoying thing is there doesnt seem to be a way in game to turn off the music, or invert the controls. Oh, it doesnt appear that ps4 titles that are also available as a ps5 title say like call of duty cold war has a free upgrade from ps4 to ps5, they want an extra $10 to upgrade the ps4 version to ps5 :( , i had thought they were free upgrades, guess not unless it was just cod cold war title. I didnt check others yet like watch dogs legion.The new UI takes some getting use to,also there are no ps5 themes as of yet and ps4 themes no work. Dont forget to look into all the launch problems to avoid possibly bricking youre ps5, theres a new software update for the ps5. I did the initial setup and i had previously downloaded the update through sony and installed it from a usb stick just to be ""safe"" . No one knows for sure yet what exactly was in the update so who knows it there were any of the big issues fixed.*update*If you cheap out on a ps5 game and get the ps4 version cause free ps5 upgrade and you play for a bit on the ps4 youre game save for that game will not carry over to the ps5 version, once you update the game to ps5 you have to start all over again.",1,english
Mike,5,"Review of the actual system, not a salty rant from missing out",the United States ,20201114,False,"  This is an actual review of the system, not a salty review of someone who missed out for the 10th time. There's other forums for that, but I'll spare you for now.I'm a casual gamer, and play when I can. PS4 was a great system, but PS5 takes it to the next level. The graphics are most noticable when you get to gameplay, as many of these games you can't tell the characters are actually fake and not actual humans. Sound is rich and navigating around is smooth. The console itself is HUGE.The selling point is the controller. The adaptive feedback is legit, and takes gaming to the next level.

Resell Tech,5,PS5 Console and Controller,the United States ,20201113,False,"  I bought the launch PS4 back in 2013 and it worked great until the last few months, as if it knew i was about to get the next gen PS5. Here is a quick breakdown of what I like and dislike about this console:LIKE- Fantastic new controller- Streamlined UI puts games first- Great exclusive game lineup- Included Astro's Playroom game is fantasticDON'T LIKE- The bold design is borderline impractical for small spaces- Syncing up cloud saves can be a pain- I don't love the clunky-feeling plastic standLOOKS:The PS5 is far and away the most flamboyant-looking console I’ve ever owned. It is obviously not the first white console but its sheer size and shape make it stand out in a room. Even though i am a little skeptical how easily dust and scratches will accumulate on the cheap looking plastic.Looking at the PS5 from the front, you will find access to the ultra Blu-ray optical drive, a high speed USB type-C port, as well as the power button and eject button. These buttons are adjacent to each other but the eject button is noticeably smaller so, if you’re anything like me, there’s now hope of not spending an entire generation trying to remember which button is which. On the back there’s the figure-8 power connection, an HDMI 2.1 out, two super-speed USB Type-A ports, and an Ethernet port. Unlike the PS4, the PS5 does not feature an optical audio out. The stand is necessary because the misshapen nature of the plates means the PS5 can’t sit flat on its side properly without it. It has a pair of small hooks, which loosely clutch the back of the PS5, and a rotating base. Sitting flat, the console is simply perched on the stand without any additional fixtures. The base can flap around and slip left, right, or even off entirely, but that’s something unlikely to frustrate unless you’re regularly moving your console from place to place. Positioned vertically, a single screw is required to affix the stand to the console to prevent it from falling out of it. The slotted, “cheese head” screw comes stored in the stand itself and is easy to install; if you don’t have a flat screwdriver, a knife or even your thumbnail will suffice.USER INTERFACE:The other key point of difference are dubbed Cards, which are also presented on screen when you hit the PlayStation button. Some of these are just fluff, like links to newly-published articles about games you’re following on PlayStation and recent screenshots, though the Activity Cards seem to have the potential to be a little more useful. There’s information about how much longer it’s estimated you’ll need to complete a certain level or task, or the ability to immediately view pre-made game hints without having to reach for your phone. For example, it was revealed earlier this week the PS5 remake of Demon’s Souls will feature over 180 help videos that players can opt to watch if they get stuck. The ultimate value of the Activity Cards is hard to gauge at the genesis of the PS5, though; hopefully developers will embrace them as useful ways to communicate to players while in-game and not turn them into lists of additional chores.The PS5’s UI does make a few changes of note for those who liked to Trophy hunt, as well as for those who like to customise their setup. On the former, Trophies are now easily accessible to view on a per-game basis from each game’s individual splash page on the dashboard, while Trophy info can also be included in the new Activity Card view. And on the latter, the PS5 doesn’t have overall themes you can select, so your dynamic themes won’t carry over. However, each PS5 game seems to come with its own mini-theme of sorts; when selecting a next-gen game on the dashboard, each game features a big piece of art alongside some music from that specific game. It may not overhaul the UI buttons like a dynamic theme could, but it’s nice to let each game in your library offer a showcase for itself.DOUBLE THE SPEED OF AN XBOX SERIES X:There’s other interesting stuff sprinkled throughout the PS5’s UI too, though, from global settings to automatically configure difficulty, subtitle preferences, and even invert the Y-axis by default – like the Xbox 360 used to do (take note, Microsoft) – to the ability to watch a friend play a game picture-in-picture while chatting to them as you play something else entirely. I’m not a particularly proficient multitasker so I can’t say I’m very interested in the latter, but the idea of not having to spend the opening moments of virtually every game inverting the Y-axis warms my old-school, upside-down heart.One of this generation’s most important upgrades is the switch from traditional hard drives to solid-state storage drives, dramatically improving loading times across the board and potentially enabling games to load in new objects effectively on the fly. The PS5’s SSD can read 5.5GB in just one second (which is, on paper, twice as fast as the Series X). In practical terms, it means I could go from powering up from a complete shutdown to perched on top of whatever Manhattan building I last left Miles Morales on in a mere 45 seconds. That still leaves time to tap your toe, but once I was in a game, the time it takes to go from selecting a save to load to actually swinging through Spider-Man: Miles Morales’ open world is basically a blink. It takes me longer to enter my passcode that it does to load a save. After generations of watching progress bars inching across a screen it’s pretty stunning stuff.Unfortunately, one of the PS5’s key strengths – its lightning-quick SSD – is also one of its weaknesses. It may say 825GB on the box but that translates to just 667GB of usable space, which is significantly smaller than the Xbox Series X’s 802GB of usable space. That’s room for maybe a dozen games, and even fewer if they’re anything like current-generation behemoths like The Last of Us Part II (78GB) or Grand Theft Auto V (94GB). As I mentioned, you can carry on using any external hard drive you may have already been using in your PS4 and continue to play PS4 games off of it, but PS5 games can only be played when installed on the SSD. And while you can open up the top lid of the console to install an additional SSD for more internal space, there are currently no Sony-approved drives on the market.VerdictWith a launch line-up dominated by games that are also available on PS4, and on the back of a generation already punctuated with incrementally more powerful hardware revisions like the PS4 Pro, the PS5 doesn’t quite land as a knockout punch yet – but it’s definitely got the power and speed to be a real contender (although the jury’s out on the stamina of that tiny 667GB SSD). However, while the PS5’s well-considered UI and blisteringly-quick loading times for PS5 games make it a pleasure to use, it’s the DualSense controller that’s proven to be the surprise haymaker I never saw coming; it truly leaves other controllers feeling primitive in comparison.",0,english

Amazon Customer,5,Get one if you can!,the United States ,20201113,False,"  PS5 is worth the wait. I got mine through Sony Playstation Store via pre order invite. It arrived on launch day.I've played Dirt 5 and Call of Duty: Cold War so far. I was able to get both running at 120 frames per second at 1080p. My TV is a Samsung RU8000 and doesn't have HDMI 2.1. It can't render 4k at 120 frames. If your goal is high frames and 4k you will need a TV with HDMI 2.1 and 8k cables. LG CX seems to be the favorite.The Haptic Feedback is game changing. You have to feel it for yourself. The triggers provide much resistance at times like in Dirt 5 they try to mimic a gas pedal. It can wear out your finger if you play too long. For CoD they have it mimicking a trigger pull and it vibrates with the recoil which feels awesome but could put you at a disadvantage to those who aren't using Haptic Feedback. I don't care though. I love the feel. If you're on the fence between XBOX Series X or PS5 the Haptic Feedback definitely tips the scales towards PS5. You're not going to get that anywhere else, at least not any time soon.",1,english

There were millions more consoles available at launch than the PS5. Keep in mind that THE WORLD is still unemployed to an extent. So not only is the demand high but it is higher for that reason as well.Now. Let’s get to it. I’ve gotten the disc and digital version. (Not both for me). This console is unbelievable. It is so quick and vibrant and the controller is unprecedented. This console is worth every penny. I do not get in console wars. I think they are pointless and childish. I have a built a PC. I have had consoles. Consoles are convenience and more entertainment centered. That being said. If you can get your hands on one whether it be for you or for others, don’t hesitate.

Brandon,2,"To Amasony, (AMAZON&SONYincasetheycantread)",the United States ,20201217,False,"  Well AMAZON & SONY, guess what? Now, at least for myself, since you both clearly show the lack you both are obviously drinched to the bone in of how little you care or appreciate the consumers that keep your companies from being another failed business, all out of greed for the accessive gains you wrench out of the honest, sincere, and consumer oriented businesses by undercutting them then stealing there customers till they go bankrupt, and you cant even try, not even a little, and that you can prove from time after time encountering the same issues, and use the same remedies and lies to sweet talk people. Enough is enough, youve proven you cannot commit to making the experience better for the customer, and i mean better as in helping out of wanting make the service a more possitive in more than just how it looks to the public, but in a selfess, down to earth, person that already has to deal with everyday life, not in a suite in a skyscraper or Mansion atop the hills. I waited long enough for next gen and am more than willing to wait far much longer if it means you wont get my business and hopefully many more down the road of your avoidance to have true PR and sloppy methods of business that you already KNOW FROM PAST OCCURRENCES when producing, supplying, and shipping a product you know very well without a doubt is going to be record setting or at least close. I understand the supply demand game and making the demand more by doing these very things because it helps boost short term sales, but in doing so you are instilling a bit of distrust and feeding that little ol voice in peoples head that sais stop, avoid this situation and go elsewhere because its gonna end negatively. So ill gladly take that step and ill save your money, and go spend it on something that will actually give good memories ill be able to enjoy later in life when im reminiscing about how the downfall of such large companies began to fall apart at the seems all because they felt they could go on without considering those paying there bills. Good luck both of you. You might do fine for awhile but you know what happens when you bite the hand that feeds you.",1,english
April Searles,5,2020 PS5 yeah boy,the United States ,20201231,False,"  Absolutely perfect console. I love it, the game play, graphics, controller, etc is awesome. for all you out there who are posting your negative responses because you decided not to pre-order while supplies last (which was advertised pre release) I'm sorry your missing out.You shouldn't be blaming Amazon and Sony for your failure to pre-order.  It's not there fault and they are doing their best to issue more consoles. You got to remember Sony isn't making any money on the console itself, it's being sold for what it costs to make.Just bare it out and eventually you will get yours. I hope they come sooner or later, happy new yr. Got mine 2020",1,english
